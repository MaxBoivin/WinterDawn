A [lexicWord]#static test# is a roll made against a [lexicWord]#difficulty level# determined by the [lexicWord]#GM#.

[lexicWord]#Difficulty level# should be based on the inherent difficulty of task, not on how difficult the task should be for the [lexicWord]#character#.

The [lexicWord]#skills# chapter and adventuring chapter offer guidelines to determine [lexicWord]#difficulty level#.
