[lexicWord]#Rolling test# are tests that can be made in multiple rolls.
The [lexicWord]#MoSes# from every roll are added together to beat the [lexicWord]#difficulty level#.
They are used for tasks which can be worked on over time.
Each roll will represent a certain amount of time passed.

Two types of [lexicWord]#rolling test# exist: [lexicWord]#first fail# and [lexicWord]#step back#.

== First Fail Rolling Test

A [lexicWord]#first fail rolling test# allows the [lexicWord]#player# to keep rolling and adding their [lexicWord]#MoSes# until one roll get no [lexicWord]#MoSes#.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A thief trying to pick a lock could do so as a [lexicWord]#first fail rolling test#; for every roll 6 seconds pass, if a roll obtain no [lexicWord]#MoSes# before they reach the [lexicWord]#difficulty level# they fail and have to start again.
====

== Step Back Rolling Test

A [lexicWord]#step back rolling test# does not fail upon a roll with no [lexicWord]#MoSes# or on a roll with [lexicWord]#loses#.
The [lexicWord]#loses# are simply subtracted from the [lexicWord]#MoSes# accumulated.
If the number of accumulated [lexicWord]#MoSes# drop to 0, the test fails.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A woodworker is building a cart.
Every day they can make a [lexicWord]#Woodworking# roll.
If on a day they score some [lexicWord]#loses#, they not only make no progress on that day but damage something they already built.
