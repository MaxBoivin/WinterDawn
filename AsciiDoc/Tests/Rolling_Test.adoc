:description: This is the description of rolling test.
include::../Include.adoc[]

Some tasks are complex and can be worked on over a long period of time; this is what [lexicWord]#rolling tests# are for.
Those tests can have higher [lexicWord]#difficulty level# and be achieved in multiple rolls.
Each roll will represent a certain amount of time passed, depending on the type of undertaking.

There are two types of [lexicWord]#rolling test#: [lexicWord]#first fail# and [lexicWord]#setback#.

== First Fail Rolling Test

A [lexicWord]#first fail rolling test# allows the [lexicWord]#player# to keep rolling and adding their [lexicWord]#MoSes# until one roll get no [lexicWord]#MoSes#.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A thief trying to pick a lock could do so as a [lexicWord]#first fail rolling test#; for every roll 6 seconds pass, if a roll obtain no [lexicWord]#MoSes# before they reach the [lexicWord]#difficulty level# they fail and have to start again.
====

== Setback Rolling Test

A [lexicWord]#step back rolling test# does not fail upon a roll with no [lexicWord]#MoSes# or on a roll with [lexicWord]#loses#.
The [lexicWord]#loses# are simply subtracted from the [lexicWord]#MoSes# accumulated.
If the number of accumulated [lexicWord]#MoSes# drop to 0, the test fails.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A woodworker is building a cart.
Every day they can make a [lexicWord]#Woodworking# roll.
If on a day they score some [lexicWord]#loses#, they not only make no progress on that day but damage something they already built.
