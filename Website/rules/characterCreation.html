<h1 id="characterCreation">Creating a Character</h1>

<p>Character are mostly defined by their prior experiences.  The process of character creation in WinterDawn is based on choosing backgrounds for this character. </p>

<h2>Background Defined Features</h2>

<p>By choosing answers to a series of questions on the past of the character, a number of skills and experience points will be made available for this character.  </p>

<h3>Background Points</h3>

<p>Each background is associated to a cost.  This cost can be related to previous background taken by the player.  More unique experiences cost more than the common ones.  This cost is paid with background points.<br><br>
Every player start with a certain amount of background points.  This number has to be decided by the GM.  A higher number of background points will allow characters with extremely unique past while a lower amount of background points will create characters with life experiences very similar to most people of their world. <br><br>
For character with some unique experiences and some common one, 25 background points would be appropriate.</p>

<h3>Skill Experience</h3>
