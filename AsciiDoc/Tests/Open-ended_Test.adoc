[lexicWord]#Open-ended tests# donâ€™t have [lexicWord]#difficulty levels# per se, but the number of [lexicWord]#MoSes# will determine how well a task is performed.
In essence, every [lexicWord]#MoS# counts as a [lexicWord]#hit#.



Examples of tasks for which an [lexicWord]#open-ended test# would be appropriate would include playing a musical instrument, running as fast as one can, cooking a nice meal, building a shelter to spend the night, etc.
