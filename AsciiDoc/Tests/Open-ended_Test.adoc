[lexicWord]#Open-ended tests# donâ€™t have [lexicWord]#difficulty levels# per se, but the number of [lexicWord]#MoSes# will determine how well a task is performed.
In essence, every [lexicWord]#MoS# counts as a [lexicWord]#hit#.

This type of test are appropriate for tasks like playing a musical instrument, running as fast as you can, cooking a feast, building a shelter for the night, etc.
