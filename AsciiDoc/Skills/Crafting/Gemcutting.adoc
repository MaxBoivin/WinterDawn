Rough precious stones can see their values greatly increased by being precisely cutting and polishing it.
[lexicWord]#Gemcutting# is the [lexicWord]#skill# used to perform this delicate operation.
It can also be used to carve or engrave stones.

== Cutting a Precious Stone

If a [lexicWord]#character# is in possession of a rough stone he can refine it into a proper cut gemstone.
The rough stone will have a size (expressed in term of burden) and a quality (flawed, decent, good, exceptional).

The [lexicWord]#difficulty level# of the [lexicWord]#test# depends on the size of the final stone the [lexicWord]#character# wants to achieve;

* 10% of the rough stone: 2
* 20% of the rough stone: 4
* 30% of the rough stone: 6
* 40% of the rough stone: 8
* 50% of the rough stone: 10

The resulting jewel will be of the same quality than the rough stone.
A [lexicWord]#character# can try to improve the quality of the stone, cutting around impurity, doing more precise cuts or polishing to a greater level.
For every level of improvement on the quality, a [lexicword]#malus# of 2 [lexicWord]#MoSes# will be applied to every [lexicWord]#roll#.

* Flawed to decent, decent to good or good to exceptional: 2 [lexicWord]#MoSes malus#
* Flawed to good or decent to exceptional: 4 [lexicWord]#MoSes malus#
* Flawed to exceptional: 6 [lexicWord]#MoSes malus#

Once the [lexicWord]#player# decided on the yield and quality he wants to achieve, he can do a [lexicWord]#first-fail rolling gemcutting test#, each [lexicWord]#roll# taking 1 hour per level of quality to be achieve (1 our for poor, 2 hours for decent, 3 hours for good, 4 hours exceptional).

.Example
[caption=""]
====
A [lexicWord]#character# has a rough stone representing 1 point of [lexicWord]#burden# and of a decent quality.
He decides to try to cut a piece of a good quality and to try to make a jewel of a exceptional quality, preserving as much of the stone as possible.
The [lexicWord]#player# decide to settle on a 50% yield, making the [lexicWord]#difficulty level# to 10 [lexicWord]#MoSes#.
Bringing the result from decent to exceptional will impose a [lexicWord]#malus# of 4 [lexicWord]#MoSes#.
Every [lexicWord]#roll# will represent 4 hours.

The [lexicWord]#gemtcutting dice-pool# of the [lexicWord]#character# is of 5d10.
The first [lexicWord]#roll# grants 1 [lexicWord]#MoS# (once the [lexicWord]#malus# is subtracted).
The next [lexicWord]#roll# grants 3 [lexicWord]#MoSes#, bringing the tally to 4.
The third [lexicWord]#roll# end-up with negative 2 [lexicWord]#MoSes# after the [lexicWord]#malus# being applied; the [lexicWord]#character# failed to create a proper jewel and wasted precious material and half a day.
====

In the case of a failure, it is possible to try again, however, the rough stone is reduced to the size of the jewel the [lexicWord]#character# was trying to achieve.

.Example
[caption=""]
====
Our [lexicWord]#character# from the previous example could retry to cut the remainder of the stone on which they previously failed.
The material they have now only represent Â½ point of [lexicWord]#burden#.
If the [lexicWord]#player# still want to try for a 50% yield, he will end up with 25% of the original rough stone.
