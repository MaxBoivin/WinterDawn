include::../Include.adoc[]

In some circumstances two or more [lexicWord]#characters# can work together on a task.
When doing so, each [lexicWord]#character# can make a roll and the [lexicWord]#MoSes# are added together to beat a [lexicWord]#difficulty level#.

The [lexicWord]#GM# can put a limit on the number of [lexicWord]#characters# who can effectively work on a task.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
Two [lexicWord]#characters# try to move a large log; they can work together and add their [lexicWord]#MoSes# to beat the [lexicWord]#difficulty level#.

== Assisted Test, Halved

[lexicWord]#Halved assisted test# are used for tasks where an assistant help but does not double the efficiency of the work being done.
In those cases, the main performer of the task count their [lexicWord]#MoSes# normally while the assistants will only add half their [lexicWord]#MoSes# to the total.
