.*_Attributes: Agility_*

Travelling on a mount, usually a horse, is much less tiring for the rider than walking.
A warrior apt at fighting on a specially trained horse is much more dangerous than the typical infantryman.

== Moving With a Mount

If an animal is trained to be ridden (it has at least 1 [lexicWord]#rank# in [lexicWord]#riding#), no [lexicWord]#test# is required to simply move around.
[lexicWord]#Tests# are needed for more complex activity or tasks that the mount could have reasons to avoid.

When a [lexicWord]#character# is mounted, he must use the movement of the mount instead of his own.
