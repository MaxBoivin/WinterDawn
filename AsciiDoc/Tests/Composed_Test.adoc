[lexicWord]#Composed tests# are use for tasks involving two [lexicWord]#skills#.
They always require a minimum of two rolls; one with each [lexicWord]#skill#.
The [lexicWord]#MoSes# from each rolls are added together to beat a [lexicWord]#difficulty level#.
If more than two rolls are required to accumulate the required number of [lexicWord]#MoSes#, the [lexicWord]#skills# used must be alternated.

[lexicWord]#Composed tests# follow the rules of [lexicWord]#rolling tests#; they can either be [lexicWord]#setback# or [lexicWord]#first fail#.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
Disabling a trap can be made with a [lexicWord]#composed test# of [lexicWord]#mechanics#, to understand the trap design, and [lexicWord]#sleight of hands#, to disable it without triggering.
It will be a [lexicWord]#first fail test#.
