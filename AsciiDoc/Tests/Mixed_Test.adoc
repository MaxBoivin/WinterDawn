Test types can be combined together in a [lexicWord]#mixed test#.
You can make [lexicWord]#open-ended assisted test#, [lexicWord]#rolling first fail opposed test#, [lexicWord]#composed group test# or any other combination.

In the case of a [lexicWord]#composed group tests# or [lexicWord]#assisted composed tests#, [lexicWord]#characters# can each focus on one specific [lexicWord]#skill#.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
Two [lexicWord]#characters# are facing a locked door.
Picking a lock is [lexicWord]#composed test# of [lexicWord]#mechanics# and [lexicWord]#sleight of hand#.
The [lexicWord]#characters# decide to work together; one will observe and study the lock, while the other will follow the instructions to move the tumblers in their unlocked position.
The [lexicWord]#GM# decide that this will be an [lexicWord]#half-assisted composed test#; only half the [lexicWord]#MoSes# scored by the [lexicWord]#player# rolling for [lexicWord]#mechanics#.
The [lexicWord]#MoS# rolled by the [lexicWord]#character# in charge of the sleight of hand will be counted in full.
