[lexicWord]#Open-ended tests# donâ€™t have [lexicWord]#difficulty levels# but the number of [lexicWord]#MoSes# will determine how well the task is performed.
In essence, every [lexicWord]#MoS# is a [lexicWord]#hit#.

Examples of tasks for which an [lexicWord]#open-ended test# would be appropriate would include playing a musical instrument, running as fast as one can, cooking a nice meal, building a shelter to spend the night, etc.
