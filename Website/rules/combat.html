<section style="position:absolute;left:30%;top:0%;width:60%;">

<h1 id="combat">Combat</h1>

<p>A good story requires drama.  Drama is conflict and conflicts can often turn to combats.<br><br>
Different characters can adopt different approach to combat but the end goal is usually the same: survival</p>

<h2 id="initiative">Initiative</h2>

<p>At the start of a combat, initiative should be rolled for every character.  An initiative roll is either a reflex or perception & vigilance test, at the discretion of the player controlling the character.<br><br>
Characters act in order of their initiative, from the highest to the lowest.   <br><br>
The initiative number of a character can change during a combat.  The prevalent causes of initiative change are detailed further in this chapter. </p>

<h2 id="rounds">Rounds</h2>

<p>Combats are organized in rounds.  A rounds is about 6 seconds (there is 10 rounds in a minute).  This is more of an average than a fix measure.<br><br>
Every round, the GM should called initiative number from the highest initiative counting down until every character had their turn.<br><br>
Each character can perform one or two actions and one movement on their initiative number.<br><br>
Characters with an initiative greater than 0 can decide to delay their turn to the negative of their initiative number.  Example: A character with an initiative of 3 could decide to wait to act at -3.<br><br>
If a character delay their turn, their initiative return to normal on the following round.<br><br>
If two or more have the same initiative score, the character with the most spirit acts first. </p>

<h3>Surprise</h3>

<p>If some characters are surprised at the start of a combat, they roll initiative normally but can only act on the first round at the negative of their roll, if this one is greater than 0.  If they roll 0 or less, they can only act from the second round.<br><br>
The number of dice used to roll initiative are also deduced from any other dice pool the surprised characters are going to use during the first round. </p>

<h2 id="actions">Actions</h2>

<p>Every rounds, each character can move up to their movement speed and do one or two of the following actions:<br><br>
- Melee Attack<br><br>
- Range Attack<br><br>
- Casting a Spell<br><br>
- Athleticism or Acrobatics action<br><br>
- Stop bleeding through Medicine or First Aid<br><br>
- Intimidation<br><br>
- Inspire their ally<br><br>
- Reassess the situation<br><br>
- Use or interact with an object<br><br>
- Any other action that can realistically be performed inside of roughly 6 seconds, at the GM discretion.  <br><br>
Those action s will be described in more details further in this chapter. </p>

<h2 id="performingTwoActions">Performing Two Actions</h2>

<p>Character with an initiative greater than 0 can perform two actions in a round.  The first action must be performed at their normal initiative number while the second action will be performed at the negative of their initiative. <br><br>
Some situations can also allow a character to perform a second action, regardless of their initiative, as a reaction.  Reactions are described further in this chapter.<br><br>
If a character decide to perform two actions instead of one, they must split their dice pool between the two actions.</p>

<h2 id="dicePoolSpliting">Dice Pool Spliting</h2>

<p>If a player wants their character to perform two actions in a round they must split their dice pool between the two actions.<br><br>
The total number of dice used for both actions cannot be greater than the number of dice granted by the actions allowing the actions giving the biggest dice pool.  Only the number of dice and not the type of dice is of concern in dice pool splitting.<br><br>
Example: A player wants to intimidate a target before attacking it.  The character’s insult & intimidation skill grant them a dice pool of 3d6 while their melee attack skill allow them a dice pool of 5d8.  The player decide to use 2d6 for the intimidation roll, which they will do at their initiative number. That would leave them 3d8 for their attack, which will be done at the negative of their initiative number. </p>

<h2 id="freeActions">Free Actions</h2>

<p>Free actions are actions which do not count as part of the two actions allowed in a round.  They are either very swift actions or actions which can be performed simultaneously to other actions or movement.<br><br> 
Talking, drawing a weapon (but not sheathing) or dropping a held object are example of free actions.
Free actions do not require a test; If a task require a test, it is not a free action.</p>

<h2 id="reactions">Reactions</h2>

<p>Reactions are actions which can be performed out of the initiative order, when some conditions are met. 
Reactions do not count as part of the two allowed actions but any dice used in a reaction must be subtracted from the dice pools of any other action performed as per the dice pool splitting rule.<br><br>
Reactions are very common in a round.  The most common type of reactions are: <br><br>
- Defending against a melee attacked<br><br>
- Avoiding a range attack<br><br>
- Resisting intimidation or a spell<br><br>
- Attack of opportunity<br><br>
More details further in this chapter.</p>

<h2 id="movement">Movement</h2>

<p>A character can move up to their movement speed in a round.  This movement can be split, evenly or not, part of it being performed at the initiative number, the rest happening at the negative of the initiative.<br><br>
The movement can be made before or after an action or on it’s own.<br><br>
Most humanoid characters have a movement speed of 9 meters per rounds.<br><br>
The type of terrain can affect the distance a character can move in a round.  Details further in this chapter.</p>

<h2 id="rangeOfAttack">Range of Attack</h2>

<p>The range of attack represent the distance at which a weapon can effectively attack.  Every weapon has at least one range of attack but some are effective at a variety of range of attack.<br><br>
Range of attacks are divided into four types:  close, medium, long and far.</p>

<h3>Close, Medium and Long Range</h3>

<p>Those ranges are used for melee combat.<br><br>
Close range is for unarmed combat or very short weapons like knives and daggers.  In close range the opponent face each other with no more than a metre between them. <br><br>
In medium range the opponent are facing each other with 1 and 2 metres between them.  Most swords, mace and one handed axes are most effective in medium range.<br><br>
When two opponents are facing each other with 2 or 3 metres between them they are considered at long range.  Spears, halberds and great swords are at their best at long range.<br><br>
If a weapon is noted with a range of attack followed by a negative number, the weapon can still be used at this range (and cause damage) but MoSes are subtracted from any attack roll made at this range.<br><br>
More details about melee combat further in this chapter.</p>

<h3>Far Range</h3>

<p>Far range is for thrown or projectile weapons.<br><br>
Every weapon effective at far range will be noted with a number next to the far range mention.  This number represent the range increment in metres.<br><br>
More details about the far range and range increment further in this chapter. </p>

<h2 id="meleeAttack">Melee Attack</h2>

<p>If a character has an opponent inside the range of attack of a wielded melee weapon, they can attack this opponent on their initiative turn.  <br><br>
Every melee weapon has one or more melee combat specialities associated with it; the player choose one of those specialities to perform the attack.  If an attribute is noted next to a speciality, this attribute must be used to build the dice pool, otherwise, the player can choose between using power or agility.</p>

<h3>Defending Against Melee Attack</h3>

<p>If the character targeted by the attack has not used their whole dice pool on this round, as a reaction, they can make a melee combat roll of their own to defend against the attack.<br><br>
If the attacker is outside the range of attack of the defender, the defender will suffer malus to their roll.  1 MoSes is subtracted per difference in the range of attack. <br><br>
 Examples: A defender with a close range weapon defending against a long range weapon will suffer -2 MoSes from the melee combat roll while a defender wielding a medium range weapon fighting at close range will receive -1 MoS on their roll.</p>

<h3>Attacker and Defender</h3>

<p>Whenever two characters are facing each other, one is considered the attacker while the other is considered the defender.<br><br>
The attacker has to announce the number of dice they intend to use for the attack before they roll.  The defender can use this information to select the number of dice they are going to use for their defence.  The defender cannot change the number of dice used for their defence after the attacker made their roll.<br><br>
The character acting on their initiative turn to attack will be considered the attacker while the character acting out of turn as a reaction is considered the defender.<br><br>
In the case where the two characters have the same initiative number, they are both considered attackers.  In this situation, the character with the most spirit announce the number of dice they are going to use first.<br><br>
If a character uses a reactions to perform an attack of opportunity, they are considered the attacker while the target is considered the defender.</p>

<h3>Flanking and Rearing</h3>

<p>f a character is attacked by from the side or the back, they can still defend against the attack but will receive malus to their roll.<br><br>
If attacked from the flanks, they receive -1 MoS on their roll.<br><br>
If attacked from the rear, they receive -2 MoSes on their roll.<br><br>
If they win the engagement or on their turn, a character can pivot to face their opponent without spending any movement or causing attack of opportunity.</p>

<h3>Resolving a Melee Attack</h3>

<p> The MoSes obtained on the melee combat roll of the characters facing each other are compared.  The difference between the result of the two rolls is the number of hits scored by the character with the most MoSes.  <br><br>
The character the hits have been scored against lose 1 spirit points per hits.<br><br>
The hits scored can also be used for control, damage or for a mix of both.<br><br>
Damage can only be dealt if the character the hits are scored against is inside the range of attack of the weapon used by the character scoring the hits. </p>

<h3>Control</h3>

<p>Control are effects to change the situation of the combat in the favour of the character performing them.
A character can spend hits to apply one or more of the following effect:<br><br>
-1 hits: The character can move 1 metre inside the range of attack of their opponent without causing an attack of opportunity.  This only protect against the attack of opportunity from the character the hits has been scored against.  This can allow a character to move in the middle of the attack resolution.<br><br>
- 2 hits: The initiative of the character the hits have been scored against is lowered by 1.<br><br>
-2 hits: The character the hits have been scored against is moved by 1 metre in a direction decided by the player which scored the hits.  A character moved in this way can trigger attack of opportunity.  To push a character of a ledge or in a hole in this way 1 additional hit must be expended.<br><br>
-4 hits: The character the hits have been scored against is disarmed.  The weapon falls at the feet of their feet.  The character who scored the hits can spend additional hits to send the weapon flying in a random direction.  The weapon will land 1 metre away per additional hits spent. <br><br>
Multiple effects (or the same effect multiple time) can be applied on the same attack.</p>

<h2 id="rangeAttack">Range Attack</h2>

<p>If a character has a line of sight on an opponent and is equipped with a range weapon, they can try to hit them from a distance.<br><br>
Every range weapon has one or more range combat specialities associated with it; the player choose one of those specialities to perform the attack.  If an attribute is noted next to a speciality, this attribute must be used to build the dice pool, otherwise, the player can choose between using power or agility.<br><br>
Doing a range attack in the range of attack of an opponent will grant this one an attack of opportunity.</p>

<h3>Dodging Range Combat</h3>

<p>If a character is target by a range attack and is conscious of it, they can try to avoid the projectile by doing a reflex roll.  The number of MoSes obtained on that roll will be subtracted from the range combat roll of the attacker.<br><br>
Dodging cause attack of opportunity.</p>

<h3>Size Modifier</h3>

<p>The size of a character impact how hard they are to hit at range.<br><br>
Range attacks targeting mini characters receive -1 MoS.<br><br>
Range attacks targeting micro characters receive -2 MoSes.<br><br>
Range attacks targeting large characters receive +1 MoS.<br><br>
Range attacks targeting huge characters or bigger receive +2 MoSes.</p>

<h3>Range Increment</h3>

<p>The range increment of a far range weapon represent the maximum distance at which an attack can be made without suffering any malus.  <br><br>
Every time the range increment is passed 1 MoS is subtracted from the attack roll.<br><br>
Example: A weapon with a range increment of 5 metres can be used to this distance without any malus.  If this weapon is used between 5 and 10 metres, 1 MoS is subtracted from the attack roll.  If it is used between 10 and 15 metres, 2 MoSes are subtracted from the attack roll.  If it is used between 15 and 20 metres, 3 MoSes are subtracted and so forth.</p>

<h3>Resolving Range Attack</h3>

<p>The attacker rolls their attack roll with the appropriate range combat speciality.  From the MoSes obtained are subtracted all the malus which apply: the MoSes from the reflex roll of the target, the penalty inflicted by a dodge roll, the size modifier and the range increment penalty.<br><br>
The remaining MoSes are the hits of the attack.  For every hits one dice of damage can be rolled.  There is no control effects in range attack and the defender can’t affect the attacker.</p>

<h2 id="damage">Damage</h2>

<p>If the character scoring the hits is the attacker, they can roll 1 damage die per hits used.  If they are the defender, 1 damage die is rolled for every 2 hits used. <br><br>
The type of dice to be used for damage can not have more face than the damage indicated by the weapon.  If the weapon’s damage is noted as an attribute plus a number (usually power), the total is the maximum size of dice to be used.<br><br>
Before rolling the damage, the type of damage must be announced.  Most weapons can deal one or more of the three following type of damage: piercing, cutting and bludgeoning.<br><br>  
If a type of damage is followed by a negative number, the weapon can still cause this type of damage but MoSes are subtracted from the damage roll.<br><br>
The MoSes rolled on the damage roll are compared to the corresponding passive defence of the armour of the target.  The difference are the hits of the damage roll.<br><br>
For every hits on the damage roll the character receiving the damage must thick one injuries box.  All the injuries boxes ticked must be on the same line.  The character receiving the injury can decide if the injury boxes are ticked on a new line (if one is available) or if they are added to a line with previously ticked injury boxes.<br><br>
If the amount of injury boxes is greater than what is available on a line, the character becomes incapacitated.<br><br>
If a damage roll cause a major injury or worst, extra effects are added to the injury depending on the type of attack.  </p>

<h3>Damage Effect</h3>

<p>If a major injury box is ticked, an additional effect is applied depending on the type of damage.
Cutting and piercing attacks cause bleeding wounds while bludgeoning attack can stunned the target.</p>

<h3>Bleeding</h3>

<p>Piercing major injuries cause a level 1 bleeding wounds while cutting major injuries cause a level 2 bleeding wounds.<br><br>  
For every bleeding wounds a character suffer they can either subtract one die from every power and agility dice pool or one bleeding wounds get one level more severe.<br><br>
Example: A character received 1 piercing major injury and 1 cutting major injury.  Both are bleeding, the first one is a level 1 wound while the second one is a level 2 wound.  The character’s melee combat dice pool is of 5d8.  If the player rolls the whole 5 dice, the bleeding wound from the piercing injury will advance to level 2 while the bleeding wound from the cutting injury will advance to 3.  The player decide to roll 4 dice.  Their bleeding wounds from the piercing injury will advance to 2 but the bleeding wound from the cutting injury will remain at 2.<br><br>
If a level 3 bleeding wound is aggravated, the character becomes incapacitated and start bleeding to death.</p>

<h3>Stunned</h3>

<p>Bludgeoning major injury cause the character receiving it to become stunned.  The player must make a resist shock test.  This test does not count as part of the dice pool for the round but has its own dice pool. <br><br>
 The number of MoSes obtained is the limit of dice which can be used on the next round. This limit is raised by 1 on every subsequent rounds until the end of the combat or until every dice pool is back to normal.</p>

<h3>Incapacitated</h3>

<p>If a character becomes incapacitated they fall prone, their movement speed is reduced to 0 and all their dice pool are reduced to 0 dice.   The character is still aware of its surrounding but cannot perform any action.  They can only talk very low.<br><br>
If a character becomes incapacitated while suffering one or more bleeding wound start bleeding to death.<br><br>
If a character becomes incapacitated through a bludgeoning attack, they become unconscious.</p>

<h3>Bleeding to Death</h3>

<p>When a character starts bleeding to death, the player must make a natural healing test.  The character will die after a number of minutes equal to the MoSes obtained on the natural healing test + 1.</p>

<h3>Unconscious</h3>

<p>If a character is made incapacitated by a bludgeoning weapon they becoming unconscious.<br><br>
While unconscious the character is totally oblivious to its surrounding.  The only action the character can do is a resist shock rolling (step back) test.  The character regain consciousness when 10 MoSes are cumulated or at the end of the scene.</p>

<h3>Dead</h3>

<p>If a character receive any damage while incapacitated they die.  <br><br>
An ally can try to reanimate a dead character with a first-aid static test or a medicine rolling (first fail) test.  The difficulty level for both those test is equal to the number of minutes passed since the character died. </p>

<h3>Shield Defence</h3>

<p>Characters wielding shield can, one per turn, used it to protect themselves against damage.<br><br>
Shield have the special shield defence, a number representing the protection offered.<br><br>
The player willing to cause damage to the character using their shield must spend an amount of their attack hits equal to the shield defence before they can spend hits to roll damage.<br><br>
Example: A character is attacking an opponent wielding a shield with a shield defence of 1.  The attacker scores 3 hits on their attack roll and wants to roll damage.  The defender decide to use their shield so the attacker must spend one hit to overcome the shield defence and can then roll 2 damage dice.</p>

<h3>Damage to Armour</h3>

<p>When a character is receiving damage, instead of ticking injury boxes they can permanently reduce the protection of every type offered by one piece of armour by 1 per injury boxes.<br><br> 
If the protection of a piece armour of armour is dropped to 0 for all types, the piece is ruined and fall apart.
Damage can not be reduce in this way by natural armour.</p>

<h2 id="attackOfOpportunity">Attack of Opportunity</h2>

<p>An attack of opportunity is a melee attack done as a reaction to certain conditions.<br><br>
The most common cause of attack of opportunity are:<br><br>
- A character moving inside the range of attack of an opponent.<br><br>
-A character doing a range attack inside the range of attack of an opponent.<br><br>
-A character casting a spell inside the range of attack of an opponent.<br><br>
-A character fixing a wound inside the range of attack of an opponent.<br><br>
-A character reloading a weapon inside the range of attack of an opponent.<br><br>
-A character doing a reflex roll to avoid a range attack.<br><br>
-Any other action made inside the range of attack of an opponent that require to take the attention away from this opponent.<br><br>
A character can only do one attack of opportunity per round.<br><br>
A character is only entitled to an attack of opportunity if the triggering condition happens in his line of sight (in front of him or on his flanks).  Attacks of opportunity done on a target on one of the flank receive -1 MoS. <br><br>
If a character moves inside the range of attack of an opponent, the attack of opportunity can only be done at the start of the movement (if the character is already inside the range of attack and line of sight) or when the character enter the range of attack or line of sight (If the movement started outside the range of attack or line of sight).  <br><br>
If a character is inside the range of attack of multiple opponent, they can provoke multiple attacks of opportunity.<br><br>
While performing an attack of opportunity, a character is always considered the attacker.  The target of an attack of opportunity is normally considered the defender, even if the attack happens on their turn. <br><br>
Attacks of opportunity grant the attacker +1d to their roll, therefore, even if a character’s dice pool is completely depleted they can still roll at least one dice (of the appropriate type for the attribute they use for the attack).</p>

<h2 id="grappling">Grappling</h2>

<p>Grappling an opponent give access to special control effects.  To initiate a grapple the character must be art close range and score at least 2 hits on a brawling attacks.<br><br>
To perform a brawling attack the character must be at close range and wielding the appropriate type of weapon or have at least one free hand.<br><br>
Once a character is grappled, their movement speed becomes 0 and they receive -1 MoS on all their power and agility rolls. <br><br>
Both the grappler and the grappled can only attack each other (but can defend against other) and every attacks other than Brawling ones receive an additional -1 MoS.  Neither can use their shield defence.<br><br>
A grappled character can reverse the situation and become the grappler by spending 1 hit from a Brawling attack against their grappler. <br><br>
Two or more characters can grapple an opponent together.  Each potential grappler must make their attack to enter grapple normally.  The malus suffered by the grappled character are cumulative.  </p>

<h3>Moving</h3>

<p>When a character is grappling an opponent, they can move with this last one in any direction by 1 metre per hit scored on a Brawling roll.  <br><br>
This control effect cannot be used to move the grappled character off the ledge of a building or in a hole.  To do so, the throw effect is in order.</p>

<h3>Throw</h3>

<p>A throw allow a grappled to send the grappled character to the ground.  
In order to do so, 2 hits from a brawling roll must be spent.<br><br>  
The grappled character is now prone.  The grappler can either go prone with the thrown character and make it pinned or release the grapple and remain standing.</p>

<h3>Pinned</h3>

<p>A pinned character suffer the same restrictions as a grapple character but receive an additional -1 MoS on their power and agility roll (-2 MoSes total). <br><br>
A pinned character can reverse the situation and become the one doing the pinning by spending 2 hits from a brawling attack against the character pinning them.</p>

<h3>Choke</h3>

<p>A grappling character can attempt to choke the grappled character.  <br><br>
To do so, the grappling character must spend 3 hits from a brawling roll.  <br><br>
A choke can be broken by the chocked character by spending 2 hits from a brawling roll.  <br><br>
A chocked character cannot become the grappler until they break the choke.  <br><br>
A the start of their turn, on every round, a chocked character must make a resist fatigue test with a difficulty level equal to the number of round passed since the beginning of the choke.  This test does not count against the dice pool for this round or as an action. If the test is failed, the character become unconscious.  The character can regain consciousness when 10 MoSes are cumulated on a resist fatigue rolling (step back) test.  </p>

<h3>Cutting and Piercing Attack While Grappling</h3>

<p>If a grappling character scored some hits on a brawling roll against the grappled character, they can use some of those hits to roll for damage.  If the damage is of type cutting or piercing, the protection from the armour is ignored.<br><br>
Example: A character grappling an opponent try to stab the grappled character with a dagger.  They score 2 hits and decide to use them for piercing damage.  The damage roll result in 4 MoSes, those do not need to be compared to armour so the grappled character must tick 4 injury boxes on the same line. </p>

<h2 id="spiritSurge">Spirit Surge</h2>

<p>At the end of a combat, every character on the victorious side can roll either a resist fatigue or a Confidence & ego open-ended test.  Each character gains 2 spirit points per MoSes they obtained on their roll.</p>

<h2 id="specialManoeuvres">Special Manoeuvres</h2>

<p>Some special manoeuvre allow a character to perform two actions on the same initiative number.  <br><br>
Special manoeuvre still require the character to split their dice pool.  </p>

<h3>Charge</h3>

<p>A charge consist of running followed by an attack.<br><br>
To perform a charge a character must be at a distance to their target at least equal to their movement speed.  <br><br>
The charging character must make a running test.  Each MoS allow the character to move an extra 2 metres.  The MoSes unused to reach the target can be added to the charge attack roll.<br><br>
The target of the charge is entitled to an attack of opportunity (if the charging character enter their range of attack) but both characters are considered attackers. <br><br>
A charge can not cause a disarm.</p>

<h3>Defensive Stance</h3>

<p>A defensive stance is a way for a character to trade all offensive capability for a more effective defence.<br><br>  
To enter a defensive stance, on their initiative turn a character can roll a melee combart open-ended test.  The MoSes obtained can be kept until the start on the character next turn and spent to oppose the melee attack rolls made against the character.  <br><br>
Example: A character adopts a defensive stance and rolls 4 MoSes.   A first opponent attack them and obtaine 3 MoSes on their attack roll.  The defending character uses 3 of their MoSes to nullify the attack of the opponent.  If a second opponent attacks the defender and obtained 2 MoSes, the defender can use their left over MoS to reduce the attack to 1 hits.</p>

<h3>Dodge Rolling</h3>

<p>A character can move by doing a dodge roll, making them harder to be hit by range attacks.<br><br>
The player must make an acrobatics test.  For every MoS obtained the character can dodge roll for 1 metre.
For every metre moved in this way, all range attack made against this character during this round receive -1 MoS.<br><br>
If the character rolling pass in the range of attack of one or more opponents,  they can make an attack of opportunity. </p>

<h3>Mounted Combat</h3>

<p>Moving with a mount does not require a test.<br><br>
Bringing a mount which is not combat trained in the range of attack of an opponent require a riding test.  The difficulty level of such a test is equal to 1 + 1 per size category bigger than the mount.  If the mount is entering the range of attack of multiple opponents, the difficulty level is added for all those opponents and a single test is made.  If the test is failed, the mount refuse to enter the range of attack.  <br><br>
Mount have their own dice pool but act on the initiative of the rider. <br><br>
A charge made while mounted use the running skill and dice pool of the mount.<br><br>
Jumping over obstacles require a ridding test from the rider and an jumping test from the mount.  The difficulty level for both those tests is related to the obstacle to overcome, as per the athleticism rules.  The hits from the riding test can be transferred to the mount’s jumping test. If the riding test fails, the mount refuse to jump.  If the jumping test fails, the mount fails to pass the obstacle. <br><br>
When the mount or the rider receive a major injury the rider must make a riding test to remain on the horse.  The difficulty level for this test is equal to the number of major injury suffered by the rider and the mount (added together).<br><br>
If a rider falls from a mount they may suffer damage as per the regular falling rules.<br><br>
Mounted characters cannot perform dodge rolling nor shield wall. <br><br>
While fighting an opponent on foot, the mounted character is considered to be on high ground.<br><br>
A character on foot cannot choke a mounted character and all their control attacks cost 1 extra hits. <br><br>
More detailed on mounted combat in the chapter about vehicle.  </p>

<h3>Prone</h3>

<p>A character can chose to get prone or become prone due to adverse circumstances.
Getting prone takes 2 metres of movement.<br><br>
Getting up from being prone takes half a character’s movement. <br><br>
While prone, moving takes twice as much movement (every metre moved count as 2 metres).<br><br>
A prone character receives -2 MoSes on all melee combat rolls against a standing character.<br><br>
A prone character receives -2 MoSes on all range combat rolls except crossbows & firearms rolls, which receive +1d.<br><br>
A character targeting a prone character with a range attack receive -1 MoS on their attack rolls and the range increment malus is doubled.<br><br>

<h2 id="terrainModifier"> Terrain Modifier</h2>

<p>Different types of terrain can affect combat.  Terrain can hinder or advantage characters depending on the situation and on how they use the different obstacles.</p>

<h3>Difficult Terrain</h3>

<p>Different types of terrain can hinder the movement of characters.<br><br>
Difficult terrains are divided in four categories, according to how much they hinder movement.<br><br>
-Minor impediment: Every 2 metres moved count for 3.  If a character runs on such terrain, 1 MoS is used not to fall.  Example: Loose rocks on the ground or large exposed tree roots.<br><br>
-Medium impediment: Every metre moved on such terrain counts for 2.  If a character runs on such terrain, 2 MoSes is used not to fall.  Example: Muddy ground or moderately steep hill.<br><br>
-Severe impediment: Every metre moved on such terrain counts for 3.  If a character runs on such terrain, 3 MoSes is used not to fall.  Example: Icy ground or marshy land.<br><br>
-Extreme impediment: Every metre moved on such terrain counts for 4. It is impossible to run on such terrain but an athleticism or acrobatics test can increase the movement at the GM discretion.  Example: Thick bush or jagged rocks. </p>

<h3>High Ground</h3>

<p>Attacking a character on lower ground gives the character on high ground +1d. </p>

<h2 id="managingCombatWithMiniatures">Managing Combat with Miniatures</h2>

<p>In some situation it may be beneficial to use miniatures to keep track of what is happening in combat.  This is specially useful in large fight with many characters or in fight taking place in complex terrain.  <br><br>
Different manner of managing combat with miniatures exist, each with their advantages and inconveniences.  Here are some examples.</p>

<h3>Hex Grid</h3>

<img src="../images/ScatterHexGrid.svg" style:"width:100%;height:auto;"><br>

<p>The main advantage of hexagonal grid is that the centre of each hex is at the same distance to all surrounding hexes.<br><br>
The main disadvantage of hexagonal grid is that it might be harder to come by or to create.<br><br>
To simply gameplay, each hex should represent 1 metre.  In that way, a character with a movement speed of 9 metres per round can move 9 hexes on normal terrain.<br><br>
While playing on a hex grid, character should be facing toward one of the point of the hex they are standing in.  <br><br>
Random scatter roll can be done using a six sided dice with 1 being in front of the character, slightly on the left and going clockwise.<br><br>
The hexes on each side of the hex where the character stands and the whole line they make are the flanks.  The hexes behind the flanks line is the rear of the character.</p>

<h3>Square Grid</h3>

<img src="../images/ScatterSquareGrid.svg" style:"width:100%;height:auto;"><br>

<p>The main advantage of the square grid is its ease of access or of creation.  Anyone can create a square grid on any surface with a pen and a ruler.<br><br>
The main disadvantage of the square grid is the diagonal movement being of a longer distance than the horizontal or vertical one.<br><br>
One of the way to solve this is to count each diagonal as 1 square or counting every other diagonal movement as 2 meters instead of 1 metre.  This does not give an exact representation but it is simpler than calculating the hypotenuse of every diagonal movement.<br><br>
To simply gameplay, each square should represent 1 metre.  In that way, a character with a movement speed of 9 metres per round can move 9 squares on normal terrain.<br><br>
Random scatter roll can be done using a eight sided dice with 1 being in front of the character and going clockwise.<br><br>
The square on each side of the character and the line they form represent the flanks.  The squares behind this line are the rear.</p>

<h3>Gridless Map</h3>

<p>It is totally possible to manage combat with miniatures but without any kind of grid.  The GM and players can simply agree on a measure representing 1 metre, ideally in relation to the size of the miniatures, and either use a ruler, a marked string, a divider compass or simply estimating distances by eye.<br><br>
In this case, random scatter can either be rolled with a six or eight sided dice, as agreed by the group beforehand.  If you where so inclined, you could even use a 12 sided dice, in the way of a clock, to roll the random scatter.<br><br>
The flanks will be every position situated on an imaginary line perpendicular to the character direction. Everything behind that line is the rear.</p>
