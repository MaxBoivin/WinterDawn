My name is Max Boivin. I am the creator of WinterDawn and the SdA system and I would like to begin this book by thanking you for your interest in WinterDawn. I hope you and your friends will get countless hours of enjoyment and excitement from this game.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc23144899444238}} What is a Role Playing Game? ===

The chances are that most of you are already familiar with the concept of role-playing game (RPG) but it seems to be a tradition that every RPG book start with an explanation of what is an RPG. 

If you have picked up this book without any prior knowledge of what it is about, hopefully this section will enlighten you. If you are a veteran role player, you may safely skip this section but, reading it might give you a clue as to how I perceive role-playing.

A role-playing game, as the name indicate, is a game where you play a role. Players create a ''character'' with their own personality, qualities, flaws, past, ''skills'', etc. Those ''characters'' will venture together, overcome obstacles, gather treasures, defeat villains, become villains, save the day, fail and sometimes die.

Unlike most games, the players don't compete against each other and there are no winners and losers. Role playing games are fundamentally collaborative group games. There is no well define goal to reach, number of points to get or conditions for victory; the goal of the game is to create an interesting and entertaining story as a group and the only way to “win the game” is by having fun.

Since there is no clear end-point in a role-playing game, the length of the game can vary greatly; some games will last for only a few hours but most games will extend on many play session of a few hours each and can end up lasting years!

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc23146899444238}} The Game Master ===

Another big particularity of RPGs is that one of the player hold a special role: the Game Master (''GM''). Unlike the other players, the ''GM'' does not play a specific ''character'' but will give life to all the secondary ''characters'' and ''antagonists'' the ''characters'' of the other player will meet and face.

The ''GM'' also create and populate the world in which the adventures take place and will describe the sceneries and events of this world to the other players. The ''GM'' has the responsibility to prepare some kind of adventure for the ''characters'', propose the players hooks to allow their ''character ''to jump on such adventures and present encounters and challenges for the ''characters'' to overcome.

The ''GM'' will also act in a way as a referee for the game. In a RPG, players can have their ''characters'' attempt to do anything. It would be impossible to try to cover every situation with a clear cut rule describing how such situation is to be resolved. This is where the ''GM'' as referee comes in<nowiki>; </nowiki>''GMs'' have the responsibility to interpret the rules and decide how the plans of the players can be translated in the available mechanics. 

The ''GM ''also possesses a veto on basically everything in the game. They can decide to change or ignore a rule or to declare the plan of a player as unrealistic and not allow it. This power should be used with parsimony and restrained; if you want to alter or ignore a rule, make sure to discuss it with your player before encountering a situation where the rule is called upon (ideally before starting the game). If a player wants to attempt some crazy actions, instead of saying a strict no, the ''GM'' can try to tweak this action with the player to try to bring it back at an appropriate level of realism for the game being played or make the action extremely unlikely to succeed. If the ''GM'' decide''s'' to take this later road, once they allowed a player to attempt an action, even if they attributed to this action a ''difficulty'' ''level ''they were sure the ''character'' would fail, if this last one succeed by good fortune, the ''GM'' need to let the action be accomplished; it is now to late for veto.

Being the ''GM'' of a group is more work but it is extremely gratifying. You get to create a world and present it to the other players, to get to control many ''characters'', and you take your friends on great adventure.

Although it is the job of the ''GM'' to bring opposition to the ''characters'', they do not oppose the players; ''GM'' and the other players work together to create a dramatic story. For this story to be interesting it will need challenges to overcome and this is the main responsibility of the ''GM''. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc23148899444238}} What Material Do You Need to Play RPGs? ===

In order to play a role-playing game in general, you will need pencils, erasers, paper and dice. Some specific games require special material like playing cards, tokens, jenga<sup>tm</sup> blocks, etc.

To play WinterDawn specifically, all you need is the basic material required by most RPGs: something to write with, something to write on and polyhedral dice.

Polyhedral dice are dice of various shape and number of face. The classic set of polyhedral dice comes with 6 or 7 dice and include one die with 4 faces (d4, shaped as a pyramid), one die with 6 faces (d6, the cube used by so many games), one die with 8 faces (d8), one or two dice with 10 faces (d10, when two is included, one will usually be marked with “00”, “10”, “20”, “30”,..., up to “90”; this dice is sometime referred as a percentile dice, d% or d00), one die with 12 faces (d12) and one die with 20 faces (d20). WinterDawn uses all those dice (except the percentile one) and it would facilitate play to own a few full sets. 

Although they are not required, many groups use miniatures for a visual representation of combats and other situation where knowing the precise position of each member of the party is important. Of course, any kind of distinctive token can used in place of miniatures. Some groups will also completely forgo the use of such visual aids and rely completely on imagination and accurate description. There is no right or wrong answer here and this is simply a matter of preferences.

One more thing you will need to play a role-playing game is at least one other person; you need to be at least two players, one impersonating a ''character'' and the other one taking the role of the ''GM''.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc23152899444238}} Why I Play RPGs And Why You Should Give it a Try? ===

There is no other type of games that give you more freedom than role playing games. In RPGs, you are truly solely limited by your and your friends imagination. Video games can be a great hobby but your option will always be limited by what the developer thought off (or by the bugs they left in that you can exploit). Board games are also a lot of fun but you have clearly defined actions you can do and strict rules framing and narrowing your possibilities.

In role-playing games, you can have your ''character'' attempt to do almost anything (doesn't mean they're going to succeed). Whenever you face an obstacle, the obvious solution is not always the best and the best approach can be different from ''character'' to ''character''. RPGs really encourage the players to think outside of the box and ''GM'' should rewards imaginative solution (as long as they are realistic in the game world).

Role playing games are also a good way to spend some social time with live people, away from the screen (of course, nowadays you can play online through video call but at least you are looking at someone's face). The fact that RPGs have so little limits as to the actions you can take and the story you can create, each game is truly unique and will create long-lasting shared memories with your friends.

There are other benefits from playing role-playing games that may be more specific to certain situations. Since playing RPGs is about getting into the skin of somebody else (your ''character''), it can help develop empathy and empathy is what will save the world (or the lack thereof will doom it). 

There is also many stories of stutterers who, while impersonating their ''character'', lose their stutter, and sometimes, like in my own personal case, they can learn to lose their stutter in everyday life as well.

Role playing game can also be a fantastic teaching and learning tool. They can be used with children to have them solve problems in an engaging way, or to help them realize that their actions have consequences. It can also be used amongst adult to explore different “what if” scenarii or philosophical ideas and bring them to their logical conclusions in a ludic manner.

RPGs can also help anybody playing them develop their imagination, their problem solving skills, their confidence, their creative writing, their improvisation skill, their acting, their outgoingness and many other useful qualities.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc231508994442381}} What Qualities Do You Need to Play RPGs? ===

The only quality you really need to a RPG is to be able to spend a few hours with your fellow players without arguing and fighting over menial things.

Being imaginative and outgoing help but don't worry if you are not; those qualities will develop over time as you play. 

Playing WinterDawn may require you to do some additions and subtractions but I tried to keep those to a minimum and to keep all maths very simple. The maths involved should be accessible to everybody able to count to a hundred and then some.

So, if you are able to spend an evening with some friends without it devolving into chaos and violence, congratulations, you have what it takes to play role-playing games. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc23154899444238}} Why Did I Create this System and Wrote this Book? ===

There is many role-playing systems (rule set) and games out there and a lot of them are very good, so why create a new one? Because there are many systems out there containing wonderful ideas. I admit it, I shamelessly pillage a lot of ideas from my favourite RPG systems, tweaked them and mashed them together to create WinterDawn. I also added some of my original ideas that I came up with over my years of playing RPGs. 

I also had the desire to create a system more realist than many popular RPGs while keeping it simple enough to not be overcome with rules and details and to not slow the pace of the game too much.

While developing the SdA system, I tired to homogenize the rules so players have fewer mechanics to learn and the vast majority of the time, whenever they have to roll dice, the same mechanics is going to be used; almost everything in the SdA system is a skill check. The name SdA refers to the way most RPGs using polyhedral dice describe the number and type of dice to roll. 5d6 means to roll 5 dice with 6 faces. The “S” in SdA represents the ''skill'' level (+1) the player is about to test and the “A” represent the ''attribute'' governing this ''skill''. For example, a ''character'' with an ''acrobatics'' ''skill'' of 2 and an ''agility'' (the skill governing ''acrobatics'') of 6, will roll 3d6 whenever they need to test their ''acrobatics''. Combat will work in the same way, as casting magic, as resisting the effect of a spell or from the elements; all those are skills.

The reason I went with this dice system is that it gives a good tactile feedback of the ability of your ''character''. You can feel in your hand, before you roll, the difference between a task you are good at and one you are mediocre. Unlike when you are always rolling a 20 sided dice and adding different number to represent your competency, you can feel the varying odd of success, in you favour when you roll 5d12, not so much if you can only roll 1d4. 

The other things that was important for me to include in the SdA systems were a dynamic combat based on choice and trade-off from the player where you don’t just spend your time waiting for your initiative number, damage and injuries with consequences, different types of armours and weapons which matter for more than cosmetic reasons, ''characters'' not based on classes and a progression not based on level but where ''skills'' increase as they are used. Most of those mechanics exist in other systems in one way or another, I recognize that, but I wanted to bring them all together in harmony, in the same system, in a coherent and easy to learn manner. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc31299899444238}} Guidelines, Not Rules ===

The goal of a role-playing game should be to collaboratively create a story. All the players, including the ''GM'', should work together towards this goal. If the rules ever get in the way of the story, the ''GM'' can always decide to put them aside, tweak them, bend them. 

It is also always possible at the start of a new campaign to have a discussion amongst the players and decide if some rules are going to be ignores or modified. If you do so, it would be advisable to keep the modification throughout the game or, if you realize it was a mistake or that it need a little more modifications, make sure to discuss it with everyone involved before changing anything.

In reason of the flexibility of the rules, I rather see them as guidelines. This is not a rules book but a guide book. Throughout this book, I will still use the term “rules” but it is always intended as soft rules or guidelines.

Of course, every modification of those guidelines need to be approved by the ''GM''. As part f their role as referee. ''GMs'' always have the last word when it comes to guidelines interpretation, modification or abolition.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc23156899444238}} Exposing my Biases ===

I tried to design the ''SdA system'' to allow different styles of play. Some people prefer more fantastic games, some prefer more gritty one. Some ''GM'' will run game of epic proportions where the ''characters'' need to save the world while other will present scenarii much more toned down. There is no correct type of game. The best option is the one your group of players enjoys the most. 

Even though I tried to minimize my bias towards one specific type of play, some will still be apparent in the fundamental design of the system. In a desire of transparency, I decided to be upfront about it and declare my biases right here, in the introduction of the book. I hope you won't take this as meaning that if your preferences vary, ''WinterDawn'' won't be adapted for your style of play (and I hope even more that it is not the case).

When it comes to magic, I always preferred setting where magic is rare, strange and scary. Only a few people can practice it, sometimes it has to be done underground, without the authorities or the non-initiated finding out.

As for the power level of the ''characters'', I always enjoy starting out a game with ''characters'' who are barely more competent than the average person of the setting. Slightly above average. I truly enjoy experiencing the growth of a ''character'' until they become exceptional individuals. I believe that what makes someone a hero is not their aptitudes, skills and abilities but the way they act in extraordinary situations. 

I can see the appeal of epic game but I've always been more inclined towards more toned down scope, campaign where ''characters'' pursue more personal goals. I like those ''characters'' to be mostly good but, to have them in very grey situations where there is no perfectly palatable solution.

I also enjoy more realistic game with deadly combats, where you have to think twice before resorting to violence. 

I usually run combats with miniatures on a hexagonal grid with the ''characters'' facing towards a point (instead of an edge) so there are two hexes in front of the ''character'' two on their side (one on each) and two in their back. 

Finally, I have to add, I always add a bias towards orcs and against elves. I tried to keep all the race more or less balanced but, even though there are not necessarily more powerful, I find the orcs cooler than the rest. I'm sure many people will disagree with me and that is perfect. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc23158899444238}} About the Organization of this Book ===

I tried to present the information in this book in the manner that made the most sense to me. Many RPGs begin by presenting the ''character'' creation and, since this is the first thing you do before playing, I can see how this make sense but, I always felt like knowing about what skills and abilities you get and how they alter the mechanics is not that useful if you don't know how the basic mechanics function. For that reason, I tried to present the basics of the SdA systems and building up from there. If you feel like this order is counter-intuitive, feel free to jump around to whatever section you desire but be warned that as you get further in the book, the assumption will be made that you read through the previous sections. 

After each section, I will include a summary of the main points of the section. You will also find at the end of the books a very useful appendices section, full of charts and cheat sheets for a wide variety of situations. 

As you may have already noticed, this book is divided in sub books (you are currently reading book 0). I wanted this book to be all-inclusive and give you everything you need to play instead of have you purchase a player's handbook, then a ''GM'' guide, then a bestiary, then a world setting, etc. I might not be the best financial decision but I realize money is scarce for everyone. My desire was to offer the best value and an unlimited number of hours of play for the investment you made in this book.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc23160899444238}} About the Writing Style of this Book ===

This chapter excepted, I aimed while writing this book to use a technical style and focus on clarity rather than style. For that reason, I didn't bother too much with repetitions or to add flourish to the text. I tried to used simple sentence structure and plain English. 

Throughout the book I used as much as I could gender neutral pronouns in an effort to be as inclusive as I could. I decide to go with the grammatically controversial singular “they”, “their” and “themself”.

I also decided to design the SdA system on a metric basis. Movement and weapon range are calculated in metres, weight are calculated in kilograms and temperature is in Celsius. The reason I favoured the metric system over the imperial one is for its international adoption and simplicity. Even someone who has never been exposed to the metrics systems can grasp its way of being subdivided rather quickly. It is much easier to remember and to calculate with a system where everything is based on base 10 rather than remembering that 16 ounces make a pound and 14 pounds make a stone but 12 inches make a foot while 3 feet make a yard but it takes 1760 yards to make a mile. 

The metric system also avoid confusion when a decimal notation is used. If something is 5.3 pounds you have to know that it is actually 5 pounds and 4 ounces and 6 drachms and 1 scruple and some minims. And this is even without mentioning the possible confusion between the ounce and the troy ounce!

If you categorically refuse to use the metric system, a conversion chart is available at the end of the book with corresponding measure not exact but close enough to not break the systems and simple enough to calculate mentally (for example, 1 metre become 3 feet instead of 3 feet and 3 inches, a.k.a 3¼ or 3.25 feet). 

You will find at the end of this book an extensive appendices section. My aim was to allow players with a basic to intermediate grasp of the rules to be able to play using only this last section. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc23162899444238}} About the Art of this Book ===

You will find that the art in this book is scares; this was an economical decision. Art is time-consuming and expensive and the page count illustrations would add would have had a repercussion on the price. And had we decided to print in full colour to give justice to the art, this book would have become inaccessible to many potential players. Maybe one day, a special edition of WinterDawn will be published, in full colour, jammed pack with full page illustrations; one can only hope.

What was not an economical decision was the style of the art. I wanted this book to be immersive and look to a certain point like an object that could exist in the world of WinterDawn. For that reason, the illustrations in this book are inspired by medieval illuminations, most notably from the Maciejowski Bible. 




== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc23164899444238}} Terms Definition ==

As you might have already noticed in the introduction, some terms are written in ''italics''. This is to indicate that the term is used in a very specific way and refer precisely to an element of the game. Those terms should be explained as they are introduced and their definition can also be found in the lexicon section at the end of this book. I do feel like it is a good idea to define some of the most basics ones here to avoid unnecessary confusion. If you are familiar with RPGs, those terms should already be familiar to you.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38106197869381}} Player ===

The term player refers to a real world person sitting at the table, either controlling an in-game ''character'' or being the ''GM''. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc215312081442072}} Character ===

A ''character'' refers to an individual in the game world, either controlled by the ''GM'' or by another player.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc215332081442072}} GM (Game Master) ===

A player fulfilling a special role of describing the scene, impersonating the ''characters'' not controlled by the other players and acting as a referee.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc215352081442072}} Attributes ===

The physical and mental aptitudes of a ''character''. 6 ''attributes'' compose a ''character'': ''Agility'', ''Power'', ''Constitution'', ''Erudition''. ''Persona'' and ''Sagacity''.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc215372081442072}} Skills ===

Represent the different types of action a ''character'' can perform and how competent they are at it.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc215432081442072}} Test (Skill Test) ===

Whenever a player attempts an action that could succeed or fail (and if there is dramatic outcome to success or failure) a ''skill test'' can be demanded by the ''GM''. 

Different types of test exist for different situations and each one will be covered later in this book.

== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc59581726573390}} Basic Mechanics ==

In order to add some objectivity and some randomness to role-playing games, some mechanics are used to define what a ''character'' can and cannot do, how well-equipped they are to overcome different challenges and if they succeed or fail at whatever they are trying to accomplish. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc59601726573390}} Attributes ===

Six ''attributes'' define every ''character''. Those are ''agility'', ''power'', ''constitution'', ''erudition'', ''persona'' and ''sagacity''.

''Attributes'' for a humanoid ''character'' will usually vary between 4 and 12. The highest the attribute score the better. 

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">Scores below 4 are crippling, since no test with that ''attribute'' can be rolled.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">Scores of 5 or 4 are considered weak.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">An average ''attribute'' has a value of 6 or 7. </div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">Scores of 8 or 9 are considered strong.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">Scores of 10 or 11 are considered exceptional.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">Scores of 12 are considered heroic.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">Scores of 20 or higher are considered supernatural.</div>

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73201726573390}} '''Agility'''

This ''attribute'' represents the dexterity and nimbleness of the ''character''. It covers fine motor skills, eye-hand coordination and balance.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73221726573390}} '''Power'''

''Power'' represents the physical strength and explosiveness of a ''character''. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73241726573390}} '''Constitution'''

A ''character's'' ''constitution'' represent not only his health but also their resistance to different types of punishment. 

''Constitution'' also affect the rate at which a ''character'' recover from injuries.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73261726573390}} '''Erudition'''

''Erudition'' is the ''attribute'' for formal learning, academic knowledge and book-smartness. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc83711726573390}} '''Persona'''

This ''attribute'' represents the strength of personality and charisma of the ''character''.

C''haracters'' with a high ''persona'' score tend to be very polarizing individuals and will leave a strong impression on the people they meet. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73301726573390}} '''Sagacity'''

''Sagacity'' is the wisdom and common sense of the ''character''. A down to earth, no non-sense, resourceful ''character ''would be one with a high ''sagacity'' score.

If ''erudition'' is the book-smart, ''sagacity'' will cover the street-smart. While ''erudition'' is very theoretical, ''sagacity'' is the practical side of things.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc73321726573390}} Dice ===

WinterDawn is played with polyhedral dice. 6 types of dice are used: 4 sided, 6 sided, 8 sided, 10 sided, 12 sided and 20 sided.

Those dice are usually referred to by the letter “d” followed by the number of faces (d4, d6, d8, etc). If a number is noted before the letter “d”, it is to represent the number of dice. Example: “3d12” means 3 12 sided dice.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc59621726573390}} Skills ===

A large array of different ''skills'' covers what a ''character'' can reasonably be expected to do. Each of those ''skills'' is linked to one or, sometime, two or three ''attributes''.

Some ''skills'' have five specialities under them. Those specialities are added to the parent ''skill ''when relevant.

Each ''skill'' is going to be described in the following chapter.

'''Skill Specialities'''

Some ''skills'' are subdivided into specialities. Those ''skills'' should not be tested directly but tests should be made with one of the sub-skills. 

The ranks of the ''skill'' and of the ''speciality'' being tested should always be added together. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc231402140869128}} Skill Test ===

Whenever a player desires to attempt an action with a chance of failure, the ''GM'' can ask to perform a ''skill'' ''test''. 

The number of dice to be rolled for a ''skill ''test is 1 + the number of ranks in the ''skill'' being tested. The type of dice is determined by the ''attribute'' governing the ''skill'' being tested; the dice used must have no more face than the value of the ''attribute''. 

The combination of number of dice plus type of dice is called the ''dice pool''. 

Some ''skills'' are governed by more than one ''attribute''. In some cases, the circumstances will determine the appropriate ''attribute'' to use while in other, the choice will be left to the player.

Example: A ''skill ''with a rank of 3 will allow the player to roll 4 dice. If this ''skill'' is governed by an ''attribute'' with a value of 7, the player can roll 6 sided dice. His ''dice pool'' for this test would then be of 4d6. 

Even if a ''character'' has no rank in a ''skill'', the player can always at least roll 1 die.

A test can involve more than one roll and/or more than one dice-pool. The different types of test will be discussed later in this chapter. 

A skill test should only be asked for if the success or failure of an action will impact the narrative outcome.

'''Dice Pool and Roll'''

A ''dice-''pool represents the number and type of dice available to a player for their character to perform a certain task or action.

A roll is the actual dice used to perform the task or action.

In most circumstances ''dice pools'' and rolls will be the same but in some cases, a player can decide to roll fewer dice than their ''dice pool'' would allow. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc231422140869128}} Success and Failure ===

To succeed on a ''skill test'', a number of ''measure of success'' (''MoS'') equal or superior to a ''difficulty level'' must be obtained. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc231442140869128}} MoS (Measure of Success) ===

Every dice showing 4 through 7, inclusively, represent 1 ''MoS''. 

Dice showing from 8 to 11 represent 2 ''MoSes''. 

Dice showing between 12 and 15 count for 3 ''MoSes''. 

Dice showing between 16 and 19 count for 4 ''MoSes''.

Dice showing 20 count for 5 ''MoSes''. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc231462140869128}} Loss ===

Dice showing 1 subtract 1 ''MoS''. It is possible to end up with a negative number of ''MoSes'' which are called ''Losses''.Many situations have dire consequences for rolling ''losses''.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc59701726573390}} Difficulty Level ===

There is a vast difference in difficulty between different tasks; some are mundane and some can be near impossible.

Easy tasks need 1 ''MoS'' to be accomplished. Such tasks have 50% chance of being successful when attempted by an average ''character'' untrained in the ''skill'' used.

Moderate tasks need 2 ''MoSes'' to be accomplished. An average ''character'' need to be at least initiated in the skill to be tested to be able to succeed at such a task.

Difficult task need 3 ''MoSes'' to be accomplished. Those tasks will be challenging for any average ''character'', even if this one is well-trained in the ''skill'' being tested.

Very difficult tasks need 4 ''MoSes'' to be accomplished. Even a ''character'' highly trained in the ''skill'' being tested can be expected to fail such tasks about 2 times out of 3.

Near impossible tasks need 5 ''MoSes'' to be accomplished. A ''character'' accomplishing such a task in front of an audience will leave them in awe.

Legendary tasks need 6 or more ''MoSes'' to be accomplished. Witnesses of such accomplishment will have a hard time finding people to believe their recounting of the event.

Those numbers are for simple tasks which can be done in one action, in a short amount of time. 

The difficulty'' level'' is either determined by the ''GM'', by a roll made by an ''opponent'' or by different environmental factors. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc229461731980836}} Hits ===

''MoSes'' exceeding the ''difficulty level'' are called ''hits''.

Many ''skills'', ''spells'' and other abilities have varying degree of effectiveness depending on the number of ''hits'' obtained on a roll. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc59721726573390}} Types of Test ===

Not all situation call for the same type of test; in some situations a ''character'' can take their time to overcome a static obstacle while in other circumstances time is of the essence. Sometimes an additional ''character'' will work against them or assist them. Some tasks are complex and will involve multiple skills and some others don’t have a precise objective and a ''character'' will simply try to do as good as they can.

The different types of tests for those different situations are described below.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73341726573390}} '''Static Test'''

A static test is a roll made against a ''difficulty level'' determined by the ''GM''. 

''Difficulty level'' should be based on the inherent difficulty of task, not on how difficult the task should be to the ''character''. 

The ''skills ''chapter and ''adventuring'' chapter offer guidelines to determine ''difficulty level''. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73361726573390}} '''Opposed Test'''

An opposed test is one where two ''characters'' are working against each other for the completion of a task. 

A roll is made for each character. The difference between those rolls become the number of ''hits'' scored by the ''characters'' with the most ''MoSes.'' 

L''osses ''are added to the ''hits'' of the winning party.

If both ''characters'' roll the same number of ''MoSes'', the status quo is preserved. 

In some circumstances, it is impossible or unclear to determine the status quo. In those occurrences, the ''GM'' should determine if one of the ''characters ''has the advantage; this ''character'' will win the opposed test in case of a tie.

Example: A rogue tries to sneak in a manor. Their ''stealth'' test will be opposed by a ''perception & vigilance ''made by the ''characters'' who could spot him. The guards expecting intruders and looking for them will have advantage on their tests while the rogue will have advantage when opposed by the unsuspecting occupants of the manor.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73381726573390}} '''Open-Ended Test'''

Open-ended tests don’t have ''difficulty levels ''but the number of ''MoSes'' will determine how well the task is performed. In essence, every ''MoS'' is a ''hit''. 

Examples of tasks for which an open-ended test would be appropriate would include playing a musical instrument, running as fast as one can, cooking a nice meal, building a shelter to spend the night, etc.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73401726573390}} '''Rolling Test'''

Rolling test are tests that can be made in multiple rolls. The ''MoSes ''from every roll are added together to beat the ''difficulty level''. They are used for tasks which can be worked on over time. Each roll will represent a certain amount of time passed.

Two types of rolling test exist: first fail and step back.

'''''First Fail Rolling Test'''''

A first fail rolling test allows the player to keep rolling and adding their ''MoSes'' until one roll get no ''MoSes''. 

Example: A thief trying to pick a lock could do so as a first fail rolling test; for every roll 6 seconds pass, if a roll obtain no ''MoSes'' before they reach the ''difficulty level'' they fail and have to start again.

'''''Step Back Rolling Test'''''

A step back rolling test does not fail upon a roll with no ''MoSes'' or on a roll with ''loses''. The ''loses'' are simply subtracted from the ''MoSes ''accumulated. If the number of accumulated ''MoSes'' drop to 0, the test fails.

Example: A woodworker is building a cart. Every day they can make a Woodworking roll. If on a day they score some ''loses'', they not only make no progress on that day but damage something they already built. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73421726573390}} '''Assisted Test'''

In some circumstances two or more ''characters'' can work together on a task. When doing so, each ''character'' can make a roll and the ''MoSes ''are added together to beat a ''difficulty level''. 

The ''GM'' can put a limit on the number of ''characters'' who can effectively work on a task.

Example: Two ''characters'' try to move a large log; they can work together and add their ''MoSes'' to beat the ''difficulty level''.

'''''Assisted Test, Halved'''''

Halved assisted test are used for tasks where an assistant help but does not double the efficiency of the work being done. In those cases, the main performer of the task count their ''MoSes'' normally while the assistants will only add half their ''MoSes'' to the total. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73441726573390}} '''Group Test'''

A group test is in order when multiple allied ''characters'' are trying to perform the same action and are covering for each other.

Each player makes a roll. The ''MoSes'' from every roll are added and compared to the ''difficulty level''. 

The ''difficulty level ''for a group should be equivalent to the ''difficulty level'' for a single ''character'' to perform the task multiplied by the number of individuals in the group.

Example: A group of 5 ''characters'' need to cross a narrow catwalk over a chasm. The ''difficulty level'' for an individual ''character ''to cross the catwalk would be of 2 on an ''acrobatics'' test. If the party decide to do it as a group, the ''difficulty level ''become 10 but the ''MoSes'' of every player are added together. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73461726573390}} '''Composed Test'''

Composed test are tests which require two or more rolls made with different ''skills''. The ''MoSes'' are added together to beat the ''difficulty level''. 

Example: Disabling a trap can be made with a composed test of ''mechanics'', to understand the trap design, and ''sleight of hands'', to disable it without triggering. 

'''''Rolling Composed Test'''''

In some case, a test is both composed and rolling. In such a situation, the skills involved are alternated.

Example: Picking a lock will require ''mechanics'' to understand the lock and ''sleight of hand ''to pick it. Difficult lock will have high ''difficulty level'' and will require multiple roll. The player will have to alternate between ''mechanics'' and ''sleight of hand'' every roll, until the lock is unlocked or until they fail the roll.

'''Mixed Test'''

A mixed test is simply a test that combines more than one of the previous types.

Example: If two ''characters'' are working on building a cart, they can make an open-ended assisted test.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38108197869381}} Bonus and Malus ===

''Characters'' can gain bonus or suffer malus depending on the situation they have to perform a task. 

Bonuses come in two form: Additional ''MoSes'' or additional dice to a dice-''pool.'' 

Bonuses to ''MoSes'' are noted by a simple +1 ''MoS''. Bonuses to a dice-''pool are noted as +1d.''

To benefit from bonus ''MoSes ''a player must have dice leftover in their ''dice pool''. 

Bonuses giving extra dice can be used even with a depleted ''dice pool.''

Malus removes ''MoSes'' from a roll. They are noted as -1 ''MoS''. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc59741726573390}} Resounding Success ===

For a roll to be considered a r''esounding success'' two conditions must be met: 1) the task attempted must be successful and 2) the number of ''MoSes'' obtained on the roll (before adding any bonus ''MoSes'') must be equal or greater to the number of dice granted by the ''dice pool'' for this task.

R''esounding success'' can be used to regain ''spirit'' or gain experience. Details are given further in this chapter.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc83731726573390}} Complete Failure ===

A roll ending up with ''Losses ''(before any malus has been applied) is a ''complete failure'' of the ''character''.

A ''complete failure'' can cause a lost of ''spirit'' or a gain of ''experience. ''While outside of combat, if a player rolls a ''complete failure'' they must make a ''Confidence & ego'' test with a ''difficulty level'' equals to 1 + the number of ''losses''. If this roll is ''successful'', the player can put an ''experience points'' in the failed ''skill''. If the roll is unsuccessful, the ''character'' loses 1 ''spirit point ''per ranks in the failed ''skill''.

''Complete failures ''can also imply a complication. Some examples are given in the description of certain tasks. 

In case of a ''complete failure'' on an opposed test, the ''losses'' are generally added to the roll of the opposing player. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc59781726573390}} Spirit ===

''Spirit points'' represent both the stamina and moral of a ''character''.

A dice-pool can never contain more dice than the current number of spirit points of the character.

The maximum amount of ''spirit points'' for a ''character'' is equal to the sum of his ''constitution'', ''persona'' and ''sagacity''. 

''Spirit'' will vastly fluctuate during play. Many circumstances can drain or raise the ''spirit'' of a ''character''. 

'''Spirit Drain'''

Common causes of loss of ''spirit points'' include fighting, long travel, restless nights, starvation, extreme weather, seeing an ally falls in combat, etc. Each will be described in their appropriate section.

While outside of combat, rolling a ''complete failure'' can cause a lost of ''spirit''. Details in the ''complete failure'' section.

'''Increasing Dice Pool with Spirit'''

A player can also spend the ''spirit'' of their ''character'' to add dice to a dice-''pool (before any roll is made).'' One die can be added at a cost equal to the current number of dice in the ''dice pool''. A player can add to a dice-pool a number of dice equal to the rank of the skill being tested.

Example: A ''character ''with a ''cooking skill'' of 3 would have a dice-''pool of 4 dice.'' If the player wants to increase their chance of succeeding at creating a sumptuous meal, they could decide to spend 4 ''spirit points'' to add a die, 9 ''spirit points'' to add two additional dice (4 + 5) or 15 ''spirit points ''(4 + 5 + 6)'' ''to raise their ''dice pool ''to 7 dice. 

'''Regaining Spirit'''

A ''character'' can replenish their ''spirit'' in many ways: A good night of sleep, eating a good meal, being victorious in combat, witnessing a beautiful artistic performance, etc. Details about the different ways to regain ''spirit ''will be given in their respective sections. 

Whenever a ''character'' wake up from a prolonged sleep, the player can regain half their ''constitution'' worth of ''spirit points''. 

While outside of combat, whenever a player rolls a ''resounding success'', they can decide to regain 2 ''spirit point'' per ''MoSes'' instead of getting an ''experience'' point.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc59801726573390}} Improving Skills and Attributes ===

''Experience'' is gained per ''skills'' and per ''attributes'' and cannot be transferred.

A ''character'' can gain ''experience'' for their ''skills'' in a few different ways:

While outside combat, rolling a ''resounding success ''grant 1 ''experience point ''in the ''skill'' used.

While outside combat, a player rolling a ''complete failure ''could gain an ''experience point'' if they succeed a ''Confidence & ego'' test. Details in the ''complete failure'' section.

At the end of a combat, the ''GM ''should count the number of ''injuries boxes, major ''and ''minor'', of all the ''characters'' opposing the party of players. This sum represents the number of experience'' points ''to be divided amongst the players. The players are free to distribute the ''experience'' they receive between the ''skills'' they used during this combat as they see fit.

Finally, the ''GM'' is free to award ''experience points'' to a player when this one uses a ''skill'' in an original manner to advance a significant plot point. 

A player can raise the rank of a ''skill'' at any moment by spending an amount of ''experience points'' linked to that ''skill'' equal to the current rank of the ''skill ''plus 1, multiplied by 4. 

Example: a ''skill'' at a rank of 2 will cost 12 ''experience points ''((2 + 1)*4) to be raised to 3.

''Skills'' subdivided in ''specialities'' does not directly gain ''experience ''but ''experience'' is attributed to the ''speciality'' being tested. 

''Speciality'' ranks are raised in the same manner as for ''skills'' but the rank of the parent ''skill'' should always be added to the rank of the ''speciality'' for calculation of the cost.

''Skills'' subdivided in ''specialities'' are raised by lowering the rank of three different child ''specialities ''by 1 to raise the parent ''skill'' rank by 1. 

Example: A ''character'' with an ''athleticism'' rank of 1, with the specialities ''climbing ''2, ''running'' 1 and ''jumping'' 1, can subtract 1 from those three ''specialities'', brining back ''climbing'' to 1, ''jumping ''and ''running ''to 0 to increase ''athleticism'' to 2. This will not affect the ''dice pool'' of any of the three ''specialities'' which were part of the trade but will increase the ''dice pool'' of the other two ''athleticism'' ''specialities'', ''lifting & pushing'' and ''swimming''. 

Every time a player uses ''experience'' to raise the level of a ''skill ''or a ''speciality'', they can add 2 ''experience points'' in the ''attribute'' governing this ''skill.'' If this ''skill'' is governed by more than one ''attribute'', the ''experience ''can be split between the governing ''attributes''. 

''Attributes'' can be raised by spending an amount of ''experience points'' equal to the current level of the ''attribute. ''

Some ''traits'' can be purchased using ''skill'' or ''attribute'' ''experience''. Details in the ''character creation ''section.

Whenever a player spend ''experience'', either to raise a ''skill'', raise an ''attribute'' or purchase ''a trait'', they should note the amount of ''experience spent'' in the ''experience spent'' space of the ''character sheet''. This has no mechanical advantages and serve solely for the ''GM ''to balance the challenges presented to the players. 

Lowering ''specialities ''ranks to increase the parent ''skill'' does not give ''attribute'' experience and should not be included in then ''experience spent''. 

'''Mentoring'''

A ''character'' can help another improve a ''skill'' by mentoring. The mentor’s ''skill'' rank must be above the ''skill ''rank of the apprentice by at least 2 steps. 

When the mentor uses the ''skill'' to perform a task, the apprentice has a chance of gaining experience.

If the task is of a type which can be assisted, the apprentice must assist with their own ''dice pool''. Whenever the mentor rolls a ''resounding success,'' both him and the apprentice can gain an ''experience point'' in the ''skill''. If the apprentice rolls a ''resounding success'', the normal rule apply. 

If the task is one where assistance is impossible or impractical, the apprentice must looks closely. If the mentor rolls a resounding success, the experience point is attributed to the apprentice. 

'''Training and sparing'''

Two ''characters'' can work together to improve ''skills'' which require ''opposed test'' (can be the same or two different ''skills''). The two ''characters'' each make their roll normally but, whenever one of them rolls a ''resounding success'' both can put an experience points in the ''skill ''they were training. 

Sparing is training for combat ''skills''. The rules are the same as for regular combat but damage does not have to be rolled. For the ''characters ''to be eligible to gain any ''experience'' the combat must last 5 ''rounds''. 

The ''characters ''sparring do not gain ''experience ''based on the ''injuries boxes'' of their opponent but on the number of ''round'' they sparred. For every 5 ''rounds'', each ''character'' gain 1 ''experience'' ''point''.

Sparing is not limited to two ''characters''. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc86671644692597}} '''On the Side: What is a character Made Off?'''

-Name: What the ''character'' is known as.

-''Race'': The racial make up of the ''character''. Chose between High-Man, Highland Half-Man, Lowland Half-Man, Orc, Goblin, Hobgoblin, Elf, Faun and Troll.

-Description: The gender, age, height, weight and other details of the physical appearance of the ''character''.

-''Attributes'': ''Agility'', ''power'', ''constitution'', ''erudition'', ''sagacity'' and ''persona''. Those represent the base disposition of the ''character ''in each of these domains.

-''Experience spent'': The amount of ''experience points'' the player spent to purchase ''skills'', ''attributes ''or ''traits''

-T''raits'': Special features making the ''character'' unique. Some are gained on ''character creation'' while others can be gained while playing.

-Equipment: All the different piece of equipment the ''character'' carries on their person.

-''Wealth'': The money carried by the ''character'' by denomination. Three types of coins exist: Copper, Silver and Gold.

-''Encumbrance'': A mix of weight and inconvenience of the equipment carried by the ''character'' including the weapons, armour, money, food and water

-''Morality'': Where the ''character'' falls on the good and evil axis.

-''Honour'': Represent how well the ''character'' keeps their words.

-''Vice & Virtues'': Represent the inclination of the ''character'' towards different ''vices and virtues''. Each ''virtue'' lies between two vice. The five ''virtues'' are ''courage'', ''temperance'', ''generosity'', ''magnanimity'' and ''friendliness''. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc59821726573390}} '''In Short: Basic Mechanics'''

-''Dice pool'' are composed of a number of dice equal to the number of ranks in the ''skill ''being tested +1, with a number of face equal or inferior to the value of the ''attribute'' governing the ''skill''.

-''Dice pool'' are limited by the current number of ''spirit points''.

-Dice showing between 4 and 7, inclusively, count for 1 ''MoS'', between 8 and 11 count for 2, between 12 and 15 count for 3, between 16 and 19 count for 4, 20 count for 5.

-Dice showing 1 count for -1 ''MoS''.

-If more 1 are rolled than ''MoSes'', the negative ''MoSes'' are called ''losses''. 

-''MoSes'' over the ''difficulty level'' are called ''hits''.

-In case of a ''static test'', if the number of ''MoSes'' is equal or greater than the ''difficulty level'', the roll is successful.

-In case of an ''opposed test'', the ''character'' with the most ''MoSes'' wins the opposition. In case of a tie, either the status quo remains or the ''character'' with the ''advantage'' wins the opposition. 

-In case of an ''open-ended test'', the number of ''MoSes'' determine how well the task is accomplished.

-In case of a ''rolling test'', many rolls can be made, the ''MoSes'' of each being added together until the ''difficulty level ''is reached or, in the case of a ''first fail rolling test'', a ''complete failure'' is rolled or, in the case of a ''step back rolling test'', the number of ''MoSes'' falls to 0.

-In case of an ''assisted test'', more than one ''character'' can roll the same skill and add their ''MoSes'' together. For t''est'' that can be ''assisted ''partially, only half the ''MoSes'' can be added.

-In case of a ''group test'', everyone implicated must roll the skill being tested, the average of all the ''MoSes'' is used for the whole group.

-In case of a ''composed test'', multiple rolls with different ''skills'', by one or many ''characters'', are made. The ''MoSes'' are added and compared to the ''difficulty level'' for a complex task.

-Multiple type of test can be combined to form ''mixed test''. 

-A ''difficulty level ''of 1 represents an easy task; an average untrained ''character'' has 50% chance of successes.

-A ''difficulty level'' of 2 represents a moderate task. An average untrained ''character'' can not succeed at such a task.

-A ''difficulty level ''of 3 represents a difficult task. 

-A ''difficulty level ''of 4 represent a very difficult task; even highly trained ''character'' would be challenge by such a task.

-A ''difficulty level'' of 5 represent a near impossible task; witness of such an accomplishment will be awed.

-A ''difficulty level ''of 6 or higher represent a legendary difficulty; you have to see it to believe it.

-Rolling a number of ''MoSes'' equal to the available ''dice pool'' is a ''resounding success. ''If the ''character'' is outside of combat, a ''resounding success'' grant them either 1 ''experience point ''for the ''skill'' or 1 ''spirit point'' per ''MoSes'' rolled. 

-Rolling ''losses'' is a ''complete failure''. If outside of combat, a ''Confidence & ego ''test with a ''difficulty level'' equal to 1 + the number of ''losses'' must be made. If this test is successful, the ''character'' gain 1 ''experience point'' if the ''skill'' which failed. If the ''Confidence & ego ''test is unsuccessful, the ''character'' loses a number of ''spirit points ''equal to the rank of the ''failed skill. ''

-''Experience points'' are gained and spent per ''attribute'', ''skill'' and ''speciality'' and can not be transferred or exchanged.

-''Skills'' can be raised by spending an amount of ''experience points'' equal to the current rank of the ''skill ''+1, multiply by 4.

-Whenever a player increase the rank of a ''skill ''they can distribute 2 ''experience points'' amongst the governing ''attributes'' of the ''skill''. 

-''Attributes'' can be raised by spending an amount of ''experience points'' equal to the current value of the ''attribute''.

-''Skills ''with ''specialities'' can be raised by subtracting one rank from 3 different ''specialities'' under that ''skills. ''

''-Specialities'' of ''skills'' can be raised by spending an amount of ''experience points'' equal to the current rank plus the rank of the parent ''skill ''plus 1, multiplied by 4.




== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc86691644692597}} Skills ==

''Skills'' are a big part of what defines a ''character''. They are the interface with which the ''characters'' interact with the world around them.

''Skills ''can be used in many ways, to overcome many types of obstacles. It may sometimes seem obvious which ''skill'' to use in a certain situation but a ''player ''can always think outside the box and take a different approach to solve the problem at hand. 

''Skills'' (and ''attributes'') can also give information about how the ''character'' should be (role) played; a ''character ''with a high ''Confidence & ego'' will act differently than one with no ranks in this ''skill''.

In the following chapter, each ''skill'' is going to be briefly described and given some example of use. Like everything in this book, those are simply guidelines and should not limit the ''players'' or ''GM'' in the way they want to use the ''skills''. 

The ''skills'' are presented in alphabetical order. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc85751726573390}} Acrobatics ===

'''''Attribute: Agility'''''

''Acrobatics ''represents the capacity of a ''character'' to tumble, roll and balance themself.

''Acrobatics'' can be used to mitigate damage from falls, to walk on narrow ledges or pathways or to move while avoiding range attacks.

Every ''MoS'' rolled on an ''acrobatics'' test can negate one die from a damage roll ''dice pool'' from falling (falling damage are explained in the ''adventuring'' chapter).

While performing a ''dodge roll manoeuvre'', every ''MoS'' allow the ''character'' to move 1 metre. For every metre moved in this way, one ''MoS'' is subtracted from every range attack targeting the ''character''.

Narrow ledge and pathway may reduced ''movement'' ''speed'' dramatically (details in the ''adventuring'' chapter). Every ''MoS'' on an ''acrobatics ''roll can add 1 meters per rounds to the ''movement speed'', up to the regular ''movement speed ''of the ''character''.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc85771726573390}} Appraise ===

'''''Attribute: Sagacity'''''

''Appraise'' is used to determine the value of items, it is the ''skill'' to avoid being ripped-off. It is also used to evaluate the quality of gemstones or artistic pieces. 

Not every object require an ''appraise'' test to have an idea of its value; the value of common, everyday items should be pretty well-known to the ''character''. A test can be asked when a ''character'' is trying to have an idea of the value of a rare item, an intricately decorated one, or an unusual large quantity of a basic item.

The missing ''MoSes'' on an ''appraise ''roll determine by how far the evaluation of the ''character ''is. Details in the adventuring section.

Of course, value is not intrinsic to an object but is subjective and different ''characters'' can value an object differently. Circumstance can also greatly affect the value of an item; water in the desert will be much more valuable than by a spring. The ''appraise skill'' give in idea of how an item should be valued by the average person considering the actual circumstances.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc92671283846921}} Arts & Performance ===

'''''Attribute: Persona'''''

''Character'' with artistic inclination can use ''arts & performance'' to entertained or create piece of arts.

''Arts & performance'' can be used to increase the spirit of an audience; for every ''MoS'' rolled 2 ''spirit points'' can be given to a participant or a member of the audience. This test can be ''assisted'' or ''composed''. For every roll, 20 minutes must be spent.

''Arts & performance ''test are usually ''open-ended test''.

'''Acting'''

This is the ''speciality'' to impersonate somebody else. This allows a ''character'' to disguise themself, change their voice, recite lines, etc. This ''speciality'' can also be used to convincingly lie. 

'''Dancing'''

This is the art of gracious and expressive movement. A good dancer is usually very appreciated at party.

'''Drawing & Painting'''

''Drawing & painting'' allow a ''character ''to represent on paper, velum or canvas, landscape, portrait or any other pictures they can imagine.

'''Music & Singing'''

This allow a ''character ''to play musical instruments and know popular songs. 

The ''GM'' can ask the ''character'' to choose instruments they know and give penalty if this one is trying to play from an unfamiliar instrument.

If a ''character'' try to sing along a song started by some other singer, penalties can be given if the song is from a foreign culture or not a popular one.

'''Oration & Poetry'''

This is the ability to make eloquent speech and to compose and recite poetry. This ''speciality'' is not only useful for lovers and tortured poets but also to politicians and skalds.

The'' oratory & poetry skill'' can also be used to inspire allies in combat.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc85791726573390}} Athleticism ===

'''''Attribute: Power'''''

''Athleticism'' represents the pure physical power of the ''character''. It is not about grace and finesse but there is still technique involved in mustering strength. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc91271726573390}} '''Climbing'''

Sometime while adventuring, walls and cliffs get in the way and need to be climbed. Obviously, not all surface are equal and therefore, the difficulty should be adjusted accordingly.

''Climbing'' is usually a ''composed test''<nowiki>; on each </nowiki>roll the ''character'' can ascend a little more. On a complete failure, the ''character ''falls.

While ''climbing'' a tree, every two ''MoSes'' allow the ''character'' to ascend 1 metres.

While ''climbing'' a rocky surface like a cliff, one ''MoS'' is needed simply not to fall. 2 or 3 additional ''MoSes'' are needed to ascend 1 metres, depending on the smoothness of the surface.

While ''climbing ''a man-made wall, 2 ''MoSes'' are needed not to fall. 3 or 4 additional ''MoSes'' are needed to ascend 1 metres, depending on the finish of the wall. 

Different circumstances can affect the climb; ''climbing'' in the rain can subtract 1 or more ''MoSes'' for every roll while having ''climbing ''tools can reduce the number of ''MoSes'' needed to ascend.

The ''GM'' should determine the ''difficulty level ''of the climb and inform the ''player'' before this one attempt the climb.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc91291726573390}} '''Jumping'''

''Jumping'' come in two varieties: horizontal and vertical.

For vertical jump, the ''character'' can jump ½ metre plus ½ metre for every 2 ''MoSes''. 

Horizontal jump are a little more complex since there is a big difference between a standing jump and a running jump.

If the ''character'' uses no movement before ''jumping'', they can jump 1 metres plus 1 metres for every 3 ''MoSes''.

If the ''character'' uses half their movement before ''jumping'', they can jump 1 metres plus 1 metres for every 2 ''MoSes''.

If the ''character'' uses their whole movement before ''jumping'', they can jump1 metres plus 1 metres for every 1 ''MoSes''.

If the ''character'' run before ''jumping'' they can add 1 die to their ''jumping'' ''dice pool'' for every ''MoS'' used for the ''running'' test (excluding the ''hits'').

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc91311726573390}} '''Lifting & Pushing'''

It could be raising a portcullis by hand, flipping a table or pushing a boulder, ''lifting & pushing'' is concerned with moving heavy objects. 

If attempting to lift something, a ''medium'' ''character'' can lift 45 kilograms plus 45 kilograms for every ''MoS'' rolled.

''Small character ''can lift 25 kilograms plus 25 kilograms per ''MoS'' rolled. ''Mini character'' can lift 5 kilograms plus 5 kilograms per ''MoS. Micro Character'' can lift 1 kilogram plus 1 kilogram per ''MoS''.

''Large character'' can lift 80 kilograms plus 80 kilograms per ''MoS''. ''Huge'' and larger'' character'' can lift 150 kilograms plus 150 kilograms per ''MoS''.

The ''GM'' can decided to subtract some ''MoSes'' from the roll if the object being lifted is awkward to grip or slippery.

If attempting to push something more or less round, a ''character'' can push twice what they can lift.

If attempting to push something more or less flat, a ''character'' can push as much as they can lift.

The ''GM'' can decided to subtract some ''MoSes'' or reduced the ''difficulty level ''from the roll due to a slippery terrain, a slope or other circumstances that may influence the ''character'''s ability to push something heavy. Common sense should be used.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc91331726573390}} '''Running'''

When a character need to cover a lot of ground in a short time, ''running'' is the solution.

While in combat, a ''running character'' can, in a round, move half their ''movement speed'' per ''MoS,'' in addition to their regular movement!!br0ken!!

''Critical failure'' on a ''running'' test make the ''character ''prone. ''Losses'' cause 1 ''minor injury'' each. The ''GM'' can decide to allow an ''acrobatics'' test to mitigate this result. 

If the ''character'' runs for many consecutive ''rounds'', starting from the second ''round,'' they must ''split their dice pool'' to make a ''resist fatigue'' check with a ''difficulty level'' of one for every two ''rounds'' the ''character'' has been running. Every missing ''MoS'' are subtracted from the number of ''MoSes'' on the ''running ''test. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc91351726573390}} '''Swimming'''

If a ''character ''end up in the water, ''swimming'' will allow them to avoid drowning. 

While ''swimming'', a ''character'' can move half their movement speed plus 1 metres for every ''MoS'' rolled per round. 

On a ''critical failure'', the ''character'' must make a ''resist fatigue ''test with a ''difficulty level'' equal to twice the number of ''losses''. On a failure, they use their whole turn to not drown. On a ''critical failure'' on that last test, the ''character ''start sinking. 

The ''encumbrance'' of a ''character'' influence is ability to swim. For every ½ of their ''encumbrance'' limit they are carrying, one ''MoS'' is subtracted from their ''swimming ''test.

The type of water will also influence the difficulty, at the ''GM'' discretion. Water with moderate current going against the ''character ''could subtract one ''MoS'' while ''swimming'' with current could add 1. The bonus and malus could be increased for stronger current. The ''GM ''can also decide to subtract distance from the base movement of a ''character'' in a similar way to ''difficult terrain ''(described in the ''combat'' chapter).

''Swimming'' in bad weather is also significantly more difficult. ''MoSes'' can be deduced from roll and, in the case of particularly bad weather, the ''GM'' could ask for a ''swimming'' to not drown or to move at all. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc91371726573390}} Charm & Persuasion ===

'''''Attributes Persona'''''

In some situation, combat is not the best approach to solve a conflict; it can be more appropriate to use ''charm & persuasion''.

If the target of the ''charm & persuasion ''so desire, they can oppose the test with either a ''Confidence & ego'' or ''detect motive ''roll. 

If the target of the ''charm & persuasion'' is unfamiliar with the ''character'', one ''MoS'' is subtracted from their roll. If the target is unfriendly, two ''MoSes'' is deducted. If the target is hostile, 3 ''MoSes'' are negated.

If the ''character'' offer the target something this one desire, they can receive bonus dice, at the discretion of the ''GM''.

In case of a ''critical failure'', the target disposition towards the ''character'' could deteriorate or the target could decide to do the opposite of what the ''character'' was attempting to convince them to do.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc91391726573390}} Confidence & Ego ===

'''''Attribute: Persona or Sagacity'''''

''Confidence & ego'' is not a ''skill'' that call to action but is nonetheless very useful.

Every time a ''character'' roll a ''critical failure ''they can make a ''Confidence & ego'' test with a difficulty equal to the level of the ''skills ''failed (maximum 6). If the roll is successful, the character can mark an experience point next to the skill. If the test is a failure, the ''character'' lose 1 ''spirit points'' for every missing ''MoSes''.

''Confidence & ego'' can also be used to resist ''Charm & Persuasion'' or ''insult & Intimidation''. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc86711644692597}} Cooking ===

'''''Attribute: Sagacity'''''

No test is needed to prepare a regular meal with the appropriate ingredients.

If a ''character'' wants to prepare an elaborate meal, a feast, a meal for a large quantity of people, not having access to a proper kitchen or preparing a meal with not quite the sufficient ingredients, a test may be required.

The difficulty of the test is influenced by the different complications.

The ''difficulty level'' for ''cooking'' is 1 for every 4 portions of food prepared. This is doubled if an insufficient quantity of ingredients are available or if the cook does not have access to a well fitted kitchen. If both situations are combined, the difficulty is 1 per portion of food prepared. This test can be ''assisted''.

If preparing a sumptuous feast, 1 ''MoS'' is needed per guest. The test can be ''composed'' and ''assisted''.

''Hits'' add to the quality of the food and can be distributed among the guest and grant 2 ''spirit points'' each.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc93221726573390}} Crafting ===

'''''Attribute: Sagacity'''''

Buying equipment can be expensive; an alternative is to craft your own. You can also turn this ''skill ''in to a lucrative occupation.

''Crafting'' is separated by type of material. Objects made of only one type of material can be made with a ''rolling test ''with the appropriate speciality. More complex object made of many material should be made with ''composed rolling test''. 

More details on ''crafting'' is available in the equipment chapter.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc95341726573390}} '''Metalworking'''

This is useful to create weapons and armour but also all other kind of objects made of metal.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc95361726573390}} '''Scribing'''

Creating beautiful books with clear text and vibrant illuminations is done through the ''scribing'' speciality. It also includes the skills needed to bound a book together.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc95381726573390}} '''Stone-cutting'''

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc95401726573390}} '''Woodworking'''

Trees are a very useful resource: abundant, versatile, easy to harvest and transform. Due to this fact, many objects are made out of wood and ''woodworking'' is sure to come in handy for an adventurer.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc7543726868227}} Deduction & Logic ===

'''''Attribute: Sagacity'''''

If a ''character'' wants to investigate a crime, look for clues, try to solve a puzzle or any other activity requiring ''deduction & logic'', a test can be made. The ''GM'' can also allow the ''player'' to ''role-play'' the scene instead of making a test. In this case, the level of the ''skills ''should serve as an indication as to how to ''role-play'' the ''character''.

If a test is made, it can either be made as a ''fixed test'', where the difficulty represents the complexity of a puzzle or as a ''scaling test'' where the number of ''MoSes'' represent how much clues the ''character ''finds.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc95421726573390}} Detect Motive ===

'''''Attribute: Sagacity'''''

Not everybody is honest and straight forward and sometime being mislead can have dire consequences. A ''character'' can avoid being lead astray by someone else by succeeding a ''detect motive ''test.

''Detect motive'' is usually done as an ''opposed test'' against ''charm & persuasion'' or ''acting ''(when used to lie). 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc95441726573390}} Elementalism ===

'''''Attribute: Erudition or Persona'''''

''Elementalism'' is a form of magic based on the control of the five elements of ''aether'', ''air'', ''earth'', ''fire'' and ''water''.

This form of magic was first developed by the elves and is based on knowledge of the elements and a memorization of incantations and movements.

It is important for the caster to speak with a clear audible voice and to be able to move freely. It is thus impossible for an elementalist to cast a spell while silenced, while sneaking or while restrained.

Elemental magic is taxing for the caster and will drain their ''spirit''.

More details will be given about ''elementalism'' in the ''magic'' chapter.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc95461726573390}} '''Aether'''

''Aether'' is a mysterious element hard to understand for the non-initiate. According to elementalists, ''aether'' is what souls and minds are made off. It is the element of the void, where there is no ''air'', no ''water'', no ''earth'' or ''fire'' there is ''aether''. 

''Aether'' magic affect the minds and souls of people.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc95481726573390}} '''Air '''

Controlling the air, an elementalist can create powerful winds to knock down enemies, move objects remotely, fly or even turn into air themself.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc95501726573390}} '''Earth'''

Shaping the ground, melting rocks, turning their skin to stone, the control of ''earth'' if full of possibilities to defend and to harm. 

'''Fire'''

Probably the most aggressive of the elements, ''fire'' does have some peaceful use for cooking and lighting but dealing damage is its main purpose.

The teaching of ''fire'' elements is often frown upon, especially to students who haven't proven their good nature.

'''Water'''

Not so useful while in the desert but devastating while at sea, a ''water'' elementalist can create massive waves that can sink ship or high pressure jets that can cut skin. ''Water elementalism'' is also useful as protection, mainly against fire.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc95681726573390}} Insult & Intimidation ===

'''''Attribute: Persona'''''

Causing fear in people or enraging them can be quite the powerful ''skill''. ''Insult & intimidation'' can allow a ''character'' to get information, taunt or demoralized an enemy in combat.

While attempting ''insult & intimidation'', the target can ''opposed ''the test with a ''Confidence & ego'' roll for intimidation or a ''detect motive ''roll for taunt. 

Details about intimidation and taunt are given in the combat chapter.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc7545726868227}} Knowledge ===

'''''Attribute: Erudition'''''

Not everybody is made for combat and violence; some prefer books and ''knowledge''.

Having a knowledgeable ''character'' in a party can be quite useful to have access to vital bit of information.

''Knowledge'' ''specialities ''can be used to test if a ''character'' knows something at this very moment or can be used to make research and acquire ''knowledge'' about a specific subject.

'''Geography'''

''Geography'' is the ''knowledge'' of the landscape and natural features. It also allows the ''character'' to understand or make maps. ''Knowledge'' of ''geography'' also helps a ''character'' to avoid getting lost while travelling long distance and to shorten the length of travel. 

If a ''character'' draws a map, the number of ''MoSes'' represent how precise and accurate the map is. Note the number of ''MoSes'' obtained while creating the map.

The largest the area represented the more ''MoSes'' is needed to have the map useful at all.

A ''character'' can make a ''composed test'' with ''geography'' and ''painting and drawing'' to create a beautiful map and increase its value.

'''Heraldry & Nobility'''

The ''knowledge'' of the nobles, who they are, how to recognize them, recognize their coat of arms, knowing their ranks, their allies and as much information as you can about the rulers of the land.

If a ''character'' tries to identify a noble or a coat of arm, the ''difficulty'' is influence by the rank and notoriety of the noble (more important noble are easier to identify), the origin of this one (the further they are from the harder to identify) and the amount of information known about the noble.

'''History'''

''History'' does not necessarily repeat itself but it often rhymes, therefore, having a deep ''knowledge'' of ''history'' can help avoid the mistake or the past or emulate the great successes of our predecessors.

''Difficulty level'' for ''history'' test is higher the further the events the ''character ''tries to remember, the more obscure the fact is or if the ''character'' tries to remember events relating to a culture foreign to their own. 

Having a general idea of an important event from one own culture that happen in living memory would be an easy test while remembering specific details of log past event of low significance and from a different culture would be near impossible.

'''Linguistic'''

''Linguistic'' is the knowledge of languages, actual and ancient, familiar and foreign.

Every ''character'' starts by knowing one native language at a ''fluent level ''a knowing ''bastard ''at an ''intermediate'' level. ''Bastard'' is a lingua franca shared by all the race, which is a mix of words from all the different languages.

Languages come in three levels: ''basic'', allowing to understand the general idea of a conversation and to know enough word to make broken communication, ''intermediate'', which allow a ''character'' to communicate on basic subjects and ''fluent'', allowing a ''character ''to have any conversation as a native speaker. Every ranks in ''linguistic'' allow the ''character'' to raise ''language know'' by two level; they can either get a new language at an ''intermediate'' level, raise one from ''basic'' to ''fluent'', raise two from ''basic'' to ''intermediate'' or from ''intermediate'' to ''fluent'' or any other combinations.

The ''GM'' can decide to limit the language available to a ''character'' to those they have been exposed to (either through conversations or books).

If a ''character'' attempt to understand a text or a speech in a language they are not fluent in, they can make a ''linguistic'' test. The difficulty of this test depends on the complexity of the speech or text, if the ''character'' has an ''intermediate'', ''basic ''or none at all ''knowledge'' of the language or if they know a related language. The ''GM'' can decide to keep the actual difficulty secret and release information based on the roll of the ''character. Critical failure'' may leads the ''character'' to misinterpret the text or speech and get the wrong information from it.

'''Religions'''

This is ''knowledge'' of the different ''religions'' and religious rituals and beliefs of the world. 

When a ''character'' try to identify a religion or to recall facts about a religion the difficulty of the test is influenced by how obscure the religion is, how specific the information to be recalled is and how foreign is the religion.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc86731644692597}} Laws & Legal Systems ===

'''''Attribute: Erudition, Sagacity or Persona'''''

This ''skill'' is concerned by knowledge of the laws, how they apply and how to argue it. 

Test difficulty is increased if dealing with laws of regions or cultures foreign to the ''character'' or if a culture is heavily regulated and bureaucratic. Obscure or absurd laws can also be harder to know.

If a ''character ''is defending themself of an accusation of a crime, or if they are trying to convince of the guilt of someone else, they can use ''laws & legal systems'' instead of ''charm & persuasion''.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc86751644692597}} Luck ===

'''''Attribute: Persona'''''

Some people seem to be born under a good star while for other, things seems to never turn their way.

''Luck'' can be used as an ''opposed test'' while two or more ''characters'' are gambling.

It can also be used in situations where a ''character'' takes a random guess, trying to pick a path, pretending to know someone and giving a name, eating unidentified berries that might be poisonous, etc.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc86771644692597}} Mechanics ===

'''''Attribute: Sagacity'''''

Repairing mechanical or clockwork objects, creating, setting and disabling non-magical traps, creating steam, water or spring powered machine can be done with the ''mechanics skill ''(large or complex project could require the ''engineering skill'').

To repair objects, the ''GM'' must determine a difficulty based on the complexity and the state of the object.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc86791644692597}} Melee Combat ===

'''''Attribute: Agility or Power'''''

This is the ''skill'' to fight thing up close, with or without weapons. 

More details are given in the ''combat'' chapter.

'''1-Handed Axes, Clubs & Maces'''

This is the use of close range weapons consisting of a shaft, usually rather top-heavy, light and short enough to be used one handed.

Those weapons can be favoured by people with little money or people needing to fight enemies in heavy armour. Maces and clubs can also be slightly less deadly (but not necessarily less incapacitating) than bladed weapons.

Those weapons can be used quite efficiently in combination with a shield.

'''1-Handed Swords'''

This is for the use of swords light and short enough to be used efficiently with one hand.

Not particularly useful against heavy armour or against enemies with ''long range'' weapons, it is although very convenient to carry on a daily basis.

Those type of swords are often combined with shield.

'''2-Handed Swords'''

This is for the use of longer and heavier swords that require two hands to be used efficiently.

Since this type of swords does not allow to use a shield, they are often time favoured by fighter wearing heavy armour. 

'''Brawling'''

When you have to get very close and personal, when you want to grapple or try to throw your opponent on the ground, this is the ''speciality'' to use.

''Brawling'' gives access to special control attacks which can be invaluable against heavily armoured opponents; sometime the only way to defeat a fighter in full plate armour is to throw them on the ground and to stab them with a dagger in the eye slit of their helmet.

'''Polearms'''

This is for the use of long hafted weapons like poleaxes, spears, halberds and great swords.

Most of those weapons require two hands to be used but spears can be used quite efficiently with one hand and combined with a shield.

Most of those weapons can attack at ''long range''. 

Polearms are often the primary weapons of soldiers and fighter expecting trouble, keeping a sword or another smaller weapon as a back-up.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc86811644692597}} Mysticism ===

'''''Attribute: Persona or Sagacity'''''

''Mysticism'' is a form of magic coming from the gods. It is generally only performed by very pious ''characters'', ''characters'' acting in a way that please a god or gods they serve or someone chosen by a godly being.

Different gods will favour different type of spells and sometime frown upon the usage of certain others. They might also demand that their servant adopt a strict code of conduct, incarnate certain virtues or perform certain act to grant them more power.

More details will be given on the specific in the ''magic'' chapter.

'''Bless & Curse'''

The ''spells'' under that ''speciality'' are designed to buff allies and debuff enemies. Although they do not cause damage directly, they can still be a game changer in combat.

'''Cure & Heal'''

''Character'' well versed in this type of ''mysticism'' are often sought after ally of those who get in a lot of trouble.

Cure & Heal allow the mystic to help the sick and wounded to get better faster or to an extent that would not naturally be possible.

'''Divination'''

This ''speciality'' allows a ''character'' to see remotely or in the future or in the past. This can be very useful to gather all kind of information that would not be otherwise available. 

'''Necromancy'''

''Necromancy'' is the ''speciality'' dealing with everything related to death. It encompasses ''spells'' to help people peacefully passes in the afterlife, talk to the dead, dismiss spirits and ghosts or even raise the dead or resurrect ''character''. 

Many people will show a lot of distrusts towards necromancer.

'''Retribution'''

This is the ''speciality'' dealing with godly wrath. ''Spells'' under that ''speciality'' are to cause damage to enemies and little else. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc92691283846921}} Natural Healing ===

'''''Attribute: Constitution'''''

This ''skill'' represents the rate at which a ''character'' heals on their own.

When a ''character'' has sustained ''injuries'', after a full night of rest they can make a ''natural healing'' test to heal some of those ''injuries''. 

When a bleeding character falls unconscious, they must make a natural healing test. The ''character'' is going to bleed out after one minute per ''MoSes'' if they are not helped.

More details in the ''spirit, injuries and health'' chapter. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc117861283846921}} Perception & Vigilance ===

'''''Attribute: Sagacity'''''

This ''skill'' represents the awareness of the ''character'' to their surrounding. The ''GM'' can ask a ''player'' to do a ''perception & vigilance'' test whenever there is something important that the ''character'' could see or miss. On the other hand, a ''character ''can ask the ''GM'' to do a ''perception & vigilance'' test when they are actively looking for something.

''Perception & vigilance'' is the ''skill'' used to opposed ''stealth'' or ''sleight of hand'' (when used to pickpocket or cheat). 

''Perception & vigilance'' can also be used in combat to roll ''initiative''<nowiki>; this represent the rapidity at which the </nowiki>''character'' can assess and analyse the situation to make decision.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc92711283846921}} Range Combat ===

'''''Attribute: Agility or Power'''''

This is the ''skill'' to fight from afar, with all type of range weapons.

More details are given in the ''combat'' chapter.

'''Bows'''

One of the oldest weapons invented, the ''bow'' is essentially a piece of wood put in tension to release arrows.

There is of course variations of ''bows'', recurved, composite, long, short, etc, but they all essentially works in the same way.

'''Crossbows & Firearms'''

Crossbows are in a sense an evolution of the bow, but they operate differently enough to be part of a different ''speciality''.

== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc59861726573390}} Combat ==

A good story requires drama. Drama is conflict and conflicts can often turn to combats.

Different ''characters'' can adopt different approach to ''combat'' but the end goal is usually the same: survival.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc59881726573390}} Initiative ===

At the start of a combat, ''initiative ''should be rolled for every ''character''. An ''initiative'' roll is either a ''reflex'' or ''perception & vigilance'' test, at the discretion of the player controlling the ''character''.

''Character''s'' ''act in order of their ''initiative'', from the highest to the lowest. 

The ''initiative ''number of a ''character'' can change during a combat. The prevalent causes of ''initiative ''change are detailed further in this chapter. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38110197869381}} Rounds ===

''Combats'' are organized in ''rounds''. ''A round'' is about 6 seconds (''there are 10 rounds'' in a minute). This is more of an average than a fix measure.

Every round, the ''GM ''should called ''initiative'' number from the highest ''initiative'' counting down until every ''character'' had their turn.

Each ''character'' can perform one or two actions and one movement on their ''initiative ''number.

''Characters'' with an ''initiative'' greater than 0 can decide to delay their turn to the negative of their ''initiative ''number. Example: A ''character ''with an ''initiative ''of 3 could decide to wait to act at -3.

If a ''character'' delay their turn, their ''initiative'' return to normal on the following round.

If two or more have the same ''initiative ''score, the ''character'' with the most ''spirit'' acts first. 

'''Surprise'''

If some ''characters'' are surprised at the start of a combat, they roll ''initiative ''normally but can only act on the first round at the negative of their roll, if this one is greater than 0. If they roll 0 or less, they can only act from the second round.

The number of dice used to roll ''initiative'' are also deduced from any other ''dice pool'' the surprised ''characters'' are going to use during the first round. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc59901726573390}} Actions ===

Every ''round'', each character can ''move'' up to their ''movement speed'' and do one or two of the following actions:

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Melee Attack</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Range Attack</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Casting a Spell</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Athleticism or Acrobatics action</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Stop bleeding through Medicine or First Aid</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Intimidation</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Inspire their ally</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Reassess the situation</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Use or interact with an object</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Any other action that can realistically be performed inside of roughly 6 seconds, at the ''GM'' discretion. </div>

Those actions will be described in more details further in this chapter. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38112197869381}} Performing Two Actions ===

''Character'' with an ''initiative'' greater than 0 can perform two actions in a round. The first action must be performed at their normal initiative number while the second action will be performed at the negative'' ''of their ''initiative''. 

Some situations can also allow a ''character'' to perform a second action, regardless of their ''initiative'', as a ''reaction''. ''Reactions'' are described further in this chapter.

If a ''character ''decide to perform two actions instead of one, they must ''split their dice pool'' between the two actions.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc73481726573390}} Dice Pool Splitting ===

If a player wants their character to perform two actions in a round, they must split their dice pool between the two actions.

The total number of dice used for both actions cannot be greater than the number of dice granted by the actions allowing the actions giving the biggest ''dice pool''. Only the number of dice and not the type of dice is of concern in ''dice pool splitting''.

Example: A player wants to intimidate a target before attacking it. The ''character’s'' ''insult & intimidation skill'' grant them a dice-''pool of 3d6 while their melee attack skill allow them a dice-pool of 5d8.'' The player decide to use 2d6 for the intimidation roll, which they will do at their ''initiative'' number. That would leave them 3d8 for their attack, which will be done at the negative of their ''initiative'' number. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc73501726573390}} Free Actions ===

''Free actions'' are actions which do not count as part of the two actions allowed in a round. They are either very swift actions or actions which can be performed simultaneously to other actions or movement. 

Talking, drawing a weapon (but not sheathing) or dropping a held object are example of ''free actions''.

''Free actions'' do not require a test; If a task require a test, it is not a ''free action''.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc73521726573390}} Reactions ===

''Reactions'' are actions which can be performed out of the ''initiative ''order, when some conditions are met. 

''Reactions'' do not count as part of the two allowed actions but any dice used in a ''reaction'' must be subtracted from the ''dice pools'' of any other action performed as per the ''dice pool'' splitting rule.

''Reactions'' are very common in a round. The most common type of ''reactions ''are:'' ''

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Defending against a melee attacked</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Avoiding a range attack</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Resisting intimidation or a spell</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- Attack of opportunity</div>

More details further in this chapter.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc73541726573390}} Movement ===

A ''character'' can move up to their ''movement speed'' in a round. This movement can be split, evenly or not, part of it being performed at the ''initiative ''number, the rest happening at the negative of the ''initiative''.

The movement can be made before or after an action or on its own.

Most ''humanoid'' ''characters'' have a ''movement speed'' of 9 meters per ''rounds''.

The type of terrain can affect the distance a ''character'' can move in a round. Details further in this chapter.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc59921726573390}} Range of Attack ===

The ''range of attack'' represent the distance at which a weapon can effectively attack. Every weapon has at least one ''range of attack'' but some are effective at a variety of ''range of attack''.

''Range of attacks'' are divided into four types: ''close'', ''medium'', ''long'' and ''far''.

'''Close, Medium and Long Range'''

Those ranges are used for melee combat.

''Close range'' is for unarmed combat or very short weapons like knives and daggers. In ''close range'' the opponent face each other with no more than a metre between them. 

In ''medium range'' the opponent are facing each other with 1 and 2 metres between them. Most swords, mace and one handed axes are most effective in ''medium range''.

When two opponents are facing each other with 2 or 3 metres between them they are considered at ''long range''. Spears, halberds and great swords are at their best at ''long range''.

If a weapon is noted with a ''range of attack'' followed by a negative number, the weapon can still be used at this range (and cause damage) but ''MoSes'' are subtracted from any attack roll made at this range.

More details about melee combat further in this chapter.

'''Far Range'''

''Far range'' is for thrown or projectile weapons.

Every'' ''weapon effective at ''far range'' will be noted with a number next to the ''far range'' mention. This number represents the ''range increment'' in metres.

More details about the ''far range'' and ''range increment'' further in this chapter. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38114197869381}} Melee Attack ===

If a ''character ''has an opponent inside the ''range of attack'' of a wielded melee weapon, they can attack this opponent on their ''initiative'' turn. 

Every melee weapon has one or more ''melee combat specialities'' associated with it; the player choose one of those ''specialities'' to perform the attack. If an ''attribute'' is noted next to a ''speciality'', this ''attribute'' must be used to build the ''dice pool, ''otherwise, the player can choose between using ''power'' or ''agility''.

'''Defending Against Melee Attack'''

If the ''character'' targeted by the attack has not used their whole ''dice pool'' on this round, as a reaction, they can make a ''melee combat ''roll of their own to defend against the attack.

If the ''attacker'' is outside the ''range of attack'' of the ''defender'', the ''defender'' will suffer malus to their roll. 1 ''MoSes'' is subtracted per difference in the ''range of attack''. 

Examples: A ''defender'' with a ''close range ''weapon defending against a ''long range weapon'' will suffer -2 ''MoSes'' from the ''melee combat'' roll while a ''defender ''wielding a ''medium range'' weapon fighting at ''close range'' will receive -1 ''MoS'' on their roll.

'''Attacker & Defender'''

Whenever two ''characters'' are facing each other, one is considered the ''attacker'' while the other is considered the ''defender''.

The ''attacker'' has to announce the number of dice they intend to use for the attack before they roll. The ''defender'' can use this information to select the number of dice they are going to use for their defence. The ''defender'' cannot change the number of dice used for their defence after the ''attacker'' made their roll.

The ''character'' acting on their ''initiative'' turn to attack will be considered the ''attacker ''while the ''character'' acting out of turn as a ''reaction'' is considered the ''defender''.

In the case where the two ''characters'' have the same ''initiative ''number, they are both considered ''attackers''. In this situation, the ''character'' with the most ''spirit ''announce the number of dice they are going to use first.

If a ''character'' uses ''a reaction'' to perform an ''attack of opportunity'', they are considered the attacker while the target is considered the ''defender''.

'''Flanking and Rearing'''

If a ''character'' is attacked by from the side or the back, they can still defend against the attack but will receive malus to their roll.

If attacked from the ''flanks'', they receive -1 ''MoS'' on their roll.

If attacked from the ''rear'', they receive -2 ''MoSes'' on their roll.

If they win the engagement or on their turn, a ''character'' can pivot to face their opponent without spending any ''movement'' or causing ''attack of opportunity''.

'''Resolving a Melee Attack'''

The ''MoSes'' obtained on the ''melee combat'' roll of the ''characters facing each other'' are compared. The difference between the result of the two rolls is the number of ''hits'' scored by the ''character ''with the most ''MoSes''. 

The ''character'' the ''hits ''have been scored against lose 1 ''spirit points'' per ''hits''.

The ''hits'' scored can also be used for ''control, damage'' or for a mix of both.

Damage can only be dealt if the character the hits are scored against is inside the range of attack of the weapon used by the character scoring the hits. 

'''Control'''

''Control'' are effects to change the situation of the combat in the favour of the ''character'' performing them.

A ''character'' can spend ''hits'' to apply one or more of the following effect:

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">-1 ''hits'': The ''character'' can move 1 metre inside the ''range of attack'' of their opponent without causing an ''attack of opportunity''. This only protect against the ''attack of opportunity'' from the ''character ''the ''hits'' has been scored against. This can allow a ''character'' to move in the middle of the attack resolution.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- 2 ''hits'': The ''initiative ''of the ''character ''the ''hits'' have been scored against is lowered by 1.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">-2 ''hits'': The ''character'' the ''hits'' have been scored against is moved by 1 metre in a direction decided by the player which scored the ''hits''. A ''character'' moved in this way can trigger ''attack of opportunity''. To push a ''character ''of a ledge or in a hole in this way 1 additional ''hit'' must be expended.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">-4 ''hits'': The ''character'' the ''hits'' have been scored against is disarmed. The weapon falls at the feet of their feet. The ''character'' who scored the ''hits'' can spend additional ''hits'' to send the weapon flying in a random direction. The weapon will land 1 metre away per additional ''hits'' spent. </div>

Multiple effects (or the same effect multiple time) can be applied on the same attack.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38116197869381}} Range Attack ===

If a ''character ''has a line of sight on an opponent and is equipped with a range weapon, they can try to hit them from a distance.

Every range weapon has one or more ''range combat specialities'' associated with it; the player choose one of those ''specialities'' to perform the attack. If an ''attribute'' is noted next to a ''speciality'', this ''attribute'' must be used to build the ''dice pool, ''otherwise, the player can choose between using ''power'' or ''agility''.

Doing a range attack in the ''range of attack'' of an opponent will grant this one an ''attack of opportunity''. 

'''Dodging a Range Attack'''

If a ''character'' is target by a range attack and is conscious of it, they can try to avoid the projectile by doing a ''reflex'' roll. The number of ''MoSes'' obtained on that roll will be subtracted from the ''range combat'' roll of the attacker.

Dodging cause ''attack of opportunity''.

'''Size Modifier'''

The size of a ''character'' impact how hard they are to hit at range.

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">Range attacks targeting ''mini'' ''characters'' receive -1 ''MoS''.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">Range attacks targeting ''micro characters'' receive -2 ''MoSes''.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">Range attacks targeting ''large characters'' receive +1 ''MoS''.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">Range attacks targeting ''huge characters'' or bigger receive +2 ''MoSes''.</div>

'''Range Increment'''

The ''range increment ''of a ''far range ''weapon represent the maximum distance at which an attack can be made without suffering any malus. 

Every time the ''range increment ''is passed 1 ''MoS'' is subtracted from the attack roll.

Example: A weapon with a ''range increment'' of 5 metres can be used to this distance without any malus. If this weapon is used between 5 and 10 metres, 1 ''MoS'' is subtracted from the attack roll. If it is used between 10 and 15 metres, 2 ''MoSes'' are subtracted from the attack roll. If it is used between 15 and 20 metres, 3 ''MoSes'' are subtracted and so forth.

'''Resolving Range Attack'''

The attacker rolls their attack roll with the appropriate ''range combat speciality''. From the ''MoSes'' obtained are subtracted all the malus which apply: the ''MoSes'' from the ''reflex ''roll of the target, the penalty inflicted by a ''dodge roll'', the ''size modifier'' and the ''range increment'' penalty.The remaining ''MoSes'' are the ''hits'' of the attack. For every ''hit'' one die of damage can be rolled. There is no ''control'' effects in range attack and the defender can’t affect the attacker.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38118197869381}} Damage ===

If the ''character'' scoring the ''hits'' is the ''attacker'', they can roll 1 ''damage'' die per ''hits'' used. If they are the defender, 1 ''damage'' die is rolled for every 2 ''hits ''used. 

The type of dice to be used for ''damage'' can not have more face than the ''damage'' indicated by the weapon. If the weapon’s ''damage'' is noted as an ''attribute'' plus a number (usually ''power''), the total is the maximum size of dice to be used.

Before rolling the ''damage'', the type of ''damage ''must be announced. Most weapons can deal one or more of the three following type of ''damage'': ''piercing'', ''cutting'' and ''bludgeoning''. 

If a type of ''damage ''is followed by a negative number, the weapon can still cause this type of ''damage'' but ''MoSes'' are subtracted from the ''damage ''roll.

The ''MoSes'' rolled on the ''damage ''roll are compared to the corresponding ''passive defence'' of the armour of the target. The ''difference'' is the ''hits'' of the ''damage'' roll.

For every ''hits'' on the ''damage'' roll the ''character'' receiving the damage must thick one injuries'' box''. All the ''injuries boxes'' ticked must be on the same line. The ''character'' receiving the ''injury'' can decide if the ''injury boxes'' are ticked on a new line (if one is available) or if they are added to a line with previously ticked ''injury boxes''.

If the amount of ''injury boxes'' is greater than what is available on a line, the ''character ''becomes ''incapacitated.''

If a ''damage'' roll cause a ''major injury'' or worst, extra effects are added to the ''injury'' depending on the type of attack. 

'''Damage Effect'''

If a ''major injury box'' is ticked, an additional effect is applied depending on the type of damage.

''Cutting ''and ''piercing'' attacks cause ''bleeding wounds'' while ''bludgeoning'' attack can ''stunned'' the target.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73681726573390}} '''Bleeding'''

''Piercing'' ''major injuries'' cause a level 1 ''bleeding wounds ''while ''cutting major injuries'' cause a level 2 ''bleeding wounds''. 

For every ''bleeding wounds'' a ''character'' suffer they can either subtract one die from every ''power ''and ''agility'' ''dice pool'' or one ''bleeding'' ''wounds'' get one level more severe.

Example: A ''character'' received 1 ''piercing major injury'' and 1'' cutting major injury''. Both are bleeding, the first one is a level 1 wound while the second one is a level 2 wound. The ''character’s'' ''melee combat dice pool'' is of 5d8. If the player rolls the whole 5 dice, the ''bleeding wound'' from the ''piercing injury'' will advance to level 2 while the ''bleeding wound'' from the ''cutting injury'' will advance to 3. The player decide to roll 4 dice. Their ''bleeding wounds'' from the ''piercing injury'' will advance to 2 but the ''bleeding wound'' from the ''cutting injury'' will remain at 2.

If a level 3 ''bleeding wound'' is aggravated, the ''character'' becomes incapacitated and start ''bleeding to death''.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73701726573390}} '''Stunned'''

''Bludgeoning major injury'' cause the ''character'' receiving it to become ''stunned''. The player must make a ''resist shock'' test. This test does not count as part of the ''dice pool'' for the round but has its own ''dice pool''. 

The number of ''MoSes'' obtained is the limit of ''dice ''which can be used on the next round. This limit is raised by 1 on every subsequent rounds until the end of the combat or until every ''dice pool ''is back to normal.

'''Incapacitated'''

If a ''character ''becomes ''incapacitated'' they fall prone, their ''movement speed'' is reduced to 0 and all their ''dice pool ''are reduced to 0 dice. The ''character ''is still aware of its surrounding but cannot perform any action. They can only talk very low.

If a ''character'' becomes ''incapacitated'' while suffering one or more ''bleeding wound'' start ''bleeding to death''.

If a ''character ''becomes ''incapacitated'' through a ''bludgeoning'' attack, they become unconscious.

'''Bleeding to Death'''

When a ''character'' starts ''bleeding to death'', the player must make a ''natural healing ''test. The ''character'' will die after a number of minutes equal to the ''MoSes'' obtained on the ''natural healing'' test + 1.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73721726573390}} '''Unconscious'''

If a character is made incapacitated by a bludgeoning weapon, they become ''unconscious.''

While unconscious, the character is totally oblivious to its surrounding. The only action the ''character'' can do is a ''resist shock'' ''rolling (step back) test''. The ''character'' regain consciousness when 10 ''MoSes'' are cumulated or at the end of the scene.

'''Dead'''

If a character receive any damage while incapacitated, they die. 

An ally can try to reanimate a dead ''character'' with a ''first-aid static test'' or a ''medicine rolling (first fail) test''. The ''difficulty level'' for both those test is equal to the number of minutes passed since the ''character'' died plus 1. Each roll takes one minute.

'''Shield defence'''

''Characters ''wielding shield can, one per turn, used it to protect themselves against damage.

Shield have the special ''shield defence'', a number representing the protection offered.

The player willing to cause damage to the ''character'' using their shield must spend an amount of their attack ''hits'' equal to the ''shield defence'' before they can spend ''hits ''to roll damage.

Example: A ''character'' is attacking an opponent wielding a shield with a ''shield defence ''of 1. The attacker scores 3 ''hits'' on their attack roll and wants to roll damage. The defender decide to use their shield so the attacker must spend one ''hit'' to overcome the ''shield defence'' and can then roll'' ''2 damage dice.

'''Damage to Armour'''

When a ''character'' is receiving damage, instead of ticking ''injury boxes'' they can permanently reduce the protection of every type offered by one piece of armour by 1 per ''injury boxes''. 

If the protection of a piece armour of armour is dropped to 0 for all types, the piece is ruined and fall apart.

Damage can not be reduce in this way by ''natural armour''.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc60061726573390}} Attack of Opportunity ===

An ''attack of opportunity'' is a melee attack done as a reaction to certain conditions.

The most common cause of ''attack of opportunity'' are:

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">- A ''character'' moving inside the ''range of attack'' of an opponent.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">-A ''character'' doing a range attack inside the ''range of attack'' of an opponent.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">-A ''character'' casting a spell inside the ''range of attack'' of an opponent.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">-A ''character'' fixing a wound inside the ''range of attack'' of an opponent.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">-A ''character'' reloading a weapon inside the ''range of attack'' of an opponent.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">-A ''character'' doing a ''reflex ''roll to avoid a range attack.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">-Any other action made inside the ''range of attack ''of an opponent that require to take the attention away from this opponent.</div>

A ''character'' can only do one ''attack of opportunity'' per round.

A ''character ''is only entitled to an attack of opportunity if the triggering condition happens in his line of sight (in front of him or on his flanks). ''Attacks of opportunity'' done on a target on one of the flank receive -1 ''MoS''. 

If a ''character'' moves inside the ''range of attack'' of an opponent, the ''attack of opportunity'' can only be done at the start of the movement (if the ''character ''is already inside the ''range of attack'' and line of sight) or when the ''character'' enters the ''range of attack ''or line of sight (If the ''movement'' started outside the ''range of attack'' or line of sight). 

If a ''character'' is inside the ''range of attack'' of multiple opponent, they can provoke multiple ''attacks of opportunity.''

While performing an ''attack of opportunity'', a ''character ''is always considered the ''attacker''. The target of an ''attack of opportunity'' is normally considered the ''defender'', even if the attack happens on their turn. 

Attacks of opportunity grant the attacker +1d to their roll, therefore, even if a character’s dice-pool is completely depleted they can still roll at least one die (of the appropriate type for the ''attribute'' they use for the attack).

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38120197869381}} Grappling ===

''Grappling'' an opponent give access to special ''control ''effects. To initiate a ''grapple'' the ''character'' must be art close range and score at least 2 ''hits'' on a ''brawling ''attacks.

To perform a ''brawling'' attack the ''character ''must be at close range and wielding the appropriate type of weapon or have at least one free hand.

Once a ''character'' is ''grappled'', their ''movement speed'' becomes 0, and they receive -1 ''MoS'' on all their ''power'' and ''agility'' rolls. 

Both the ''grappler'' and the ''grappled'' can only attack each other (but can defend against other) and every attacks other than ''Brawling'' ones receive an additional -1 ''MoS''. Neither can use their ''shield defence''.

A ''grappled character'' can reverse the situation and become the ''grappler'' by spending 1 ''hit'' from a ''Brawling ''attack against their ''grappler''. 

Two or more ''characters'' can ''grapple'' an opponent together. Each potential ''grappler ''must make their attack to enter ''grapple ''normally. The malus suffered by the ''grappled character'' are cumulative. 

'''Moving'''

When a ''character ''is ''grappling'' an opponent, they can move with this last one in any direction by 1 metre per ''hit'' scored on a ''Brawling'' roll. 

This ''control effect'' cannot be used to move the ''grappled character'' off the ledge of a building or in a hole. To do so, the ''throw'' effect is in order.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc60081726573390}} '''Throw'''

A ''throw'' allows a ''grappled'' to send the ''grappled'' ''character'' to the ground. In order to do so, 2 ''hits'' from a ''brawling ''roll must be spent. 

The ''grappled character ''is now ''prone''. The ''grappler ''can either go ''prone'' with the thrown ''character'' and make it ''pinned'' or release the ''grapple'' and remain standing.

'''Pinned'''

A ''pinned character'' suffer the same restrictions as a ''grapple'' ''character'' but receive an additional -1 ''MoS ''on their ''power'' and ''agility'' roll (-2 ''MoSes'' total). 

A ''pinned'' ''character'' can reverse the situation and become the one doing the ''pinning'' by spending 2 ''hits'' from a ''brawling'' attack against the ''character pinning ''them.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73741726573390}} '''Choke'''

A ''grappling character ''can attempt to choke the ''grappled character''. 

To do so, the ''grappling character'' must spend 3 ''hits'' from a ''brawling'' roll. 

A ''choke ''can be broken by the ''chocked'' ''character'' by spending 2'' hits'' from a ''brawling'' roll. 

A ''chocked character ''cannot become the ''grappler'' until they break the ''choke''. 

At the start of their turn, on every round, a ''chocked character'' must make a ''resist fatigue'' test with a ''difficulty level'' equal to the number of round passed since the beginning of the ''choke''. This test does not count against the ''dice pool'' for this round or as an action. If the test is failed, the ''character'' become ''unconscious''. The ''character'' can regain consciousness when 10 ''MoSes'' are cumulated on a ''resist fatigue rolling (step back) test''. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73781726573390}} '''Cutting and Piercing Attack While Grappling'''

If a ''grappling character'' scored some ''hits ''on a ''brawling'' roll against the ''grappled character'', they can use some of those ''hits ''to roll for damage. If the ''damage ''is of type ''cutting ''or ''piercing'', the protection from the armour is ignored.

Example: A ''character grappling ''an opponent try to stab the ''grappled character'' with a dagger. They score 2 ''hits'' and decide to use them for ''piercing damage''. The ''damage ''roll result in 4 ''MoSes'', those do not need to be compared to armour so the ''grappled character'' must tick 4 ''injury boxes'' on the same line. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc231071123597363}} Spirit Surge ===

At the end of a combat, every ''character'' on the victorious side can roll either a ''resist fatigue'' or a ''Confidence & ego'' ''open-ended'' test. Each ''character ''gains 2 ''spirit points'' per ''MoSes'' they obtained on their roll.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc60101726573390}} Special Manoeuvres ===

Some special manoeuvre allow a ''character'' to perform two actions on the same ''initiative ''number. 

Special manoeuvre still require the ''character ''to split their ''dice pool''. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73801726573390}} '''Charge'''

A ''charge'' consist of running followed by an attack.

To perform a ''charge'' a ''character ''must be at a distance to their target at least equal to their ''movement speed''. 

The ''charging character ''must make a ''running ''test. Each ''MoS'' allow the ''character'' to move an extra 2 metres. The ''MoSes'' unused to reach the target can be added to the ''charge ''attack roll.

The target of the ''charge'' is entitled to an ''attack of opportunity ''(if the ''charging character'' enter their ''range of attack'')'' but both characters are considered attackers''. 

A ''charge'' can not cause a ''disarm''.

'''Defensive Stance'''

A ''defensive stance ''is a way for a ''character ''to trade all offensive capability for a more effective defence. 

To enter a ''defensive stance'', on their ''initiative turn'' a ''character'' can roll a ''melee combat open-ended test''. The ''MoSes'' obtained can be kept until the start on the ''character'' next turn and spent to oppose the melee attack rolls made against the ''character''. 

Example: A ''character ''adopts a ''defensive stance'' and rolls 4 ''MoSes''. A first opponent attack them and obtains 3 ''MoSes'' on their attack roll. The defending ''character'' uses 3 of their ''MoSes ''to nullify the attack of the opponent. If a second opponent attacks the defender and obtained 2 ''MoSes'', the defender can use their left over ''MoS'' to reduce the attack to 1 ''hits''.

'''Dodge rolling'''

A ''character ''can move by doing a ''dodge roll'', making them harder to be hit by range attacks.

The player must make an ''acrobatics'' test. For every ''MoS'' obtained the ''character ''can ''dodge roll'' for 1 metre.

For every metre moved in this way, all range attack made against this ''character'' during this round receive -1 ''MoS''.

If the ''character'' ''rolling'' pass in the ''range of attack'' of one or more opponents, they can make an ''attack of opportunity''. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73861726573390}} '''Mounted Combat'''

Moving with a mount does not require a test.

Bringing a mount which is not ''combat trained'' in the ''range of attack'' of an opponent require a ''riding ''test. The ''difficulty level'' of such a test is equal to 1 + 1 per ''size'' category bigger than the mount. If the mount is entering the ''range of attack'' of multiple opponents, the ''difficulty level'' is added for all those opponents and a single test is made. If the test is failed, the mount refuse to enter the ''range of attack''. 

Mount have their own ''dice pool'' but act on the ''initiative'' of the rider. 

A ''charge'' made while mounted use the ''running skill ''and ''dice pool'' of the mount.

Jumping over obstacles require a ''ridding test'' from the rider and a ''jumping ''test from the mount. The ''difficulty level ''for both those tests is related to the obstacle to overcome, as per the athleticism'' rules''. The ''hits'' from the ''riding test'' can be transferred to the mount’s ''jumping'' test. If the ''riding ''test fails, the mount refuse to jump. If the ''jumping ''test fails, the mount fails to pass the obstacle. 

When the mount or the rider receive a ''major injury'' the rider must make a ''riding'' test to remain on the horse. The ''difficulty level ''for this test is equal to the number of ''major injury'' suffered by the rider and the mount (added together).

If a rider falls from a mount they may suffer damage as per the regular ''falling'' rules.

Mounted ''characters'' cannot perform ''dodge rolling'' nor ''shield wall''. 

While fighting an opponent on foot, the mounted ''character'' is considered to be on high ground.

A ''character'' on foot cannot ''choke'' a mounted ''character'' and all their control attacks cost 1 extra ''hits''. 

More detailed on mounted combat in the chapter about vehicle. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73881726573390}} '''Prone'''

A ''character'' can chose to get ''prone'' or become ''prone'' due to adverse circumstances.

Getting ''prone'' takes 2 metres of ''movement''.

Getting up from being ''prone'' takes half a ''character’s movement''. 

While prone, moving takes twice as much ''movement'' (every metre moved count as 2 metres).

A ''prone'' ''character'' receives -2 ''MoSes'' on all ''melee combat'' rolls against a standing ''character''.

A ''prone character'' receives -2 ''MoSes'' on all ''range combat'' rolls except ''crossbows & firearms'' rolls, which receive +1d.

A ''character'' targeting a ''prone character'' with a range attack receive -1 ''MoS'' on their attack rolls and the ''range increment'' malus is doubled.

Getting ''prone'' behind ''cover'' can increase the protection offered, at the ''GM'' discretion.

'''Kick Up'''

A prone character can get up by doing an ''acrobatics'' test. Every ''MoS'' reduce the movement needed to get up by 1 metres. This provoke ''attacks of opportunity''. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73901726573390}} '''Reassessing the Situation'''

A player can use their action or part of their action to reroll their ''initiative''. They must use the new ''initiative'' number even if it is lower.

'''Inspire'''

A ''character'' can make a short speech to motivate their allies.

The player does an ''oratory & poetry'' test. For every ''MoS'' they can distribute 2 ''spirit points'' amongst their allies (excluding themself). 

'''Intimidation'''

A ''character'' can try to intimidate an opponent.

The player makes an ''insult & intimidation'' roll opposed by a ''Confidence & ego'' test from the target.

The ''Confidence & ego'' test of the target does not count as part of their ''dice pool''.

Intimidation functions as a ''far range'' weapon with a ''range increment'' of 5 metres for the distance malus. There is no ''size'' modifier. 

For every ''hits'' on the ''insult & intimidation'' roll, the target lose 2 ''spirit points''.

'''Taunt'''

A ''character ''can provoke a target.

The player must make an ''insult & intimidation ''test opposed by a ''detect motive'' test by the target.

The ''detect'' motive test of the target does not count as part of their dice-pool.

Taunt functions as a ''far range'' weapon with a ''range increment'' of 5 metres for the distance malus. There is no ''size'' modifier. 

Starting from their next turn, every action not directed against the taunting ''character'' have a dice-pool reduce by -1d per hits on the insult & intimidation roll. The dice-pool of the target recover 1 dice per turn.

Example: A ''character'' tries to taunt an opponent. The taunter rolls 4 ''MoSes'' on their ''insult & intimidation ''roll. The target rolls only 1 ''MoS ''on a ''detect motive'' rolls. The taunter scores 3 ''hits''. On their next turn, if the target does any action not targeted against the ''taunter'', their ''dice pool'' will be reduced by 3 ''dice''. On the following turn, the malus will be reduced to 2 dice, then 1 dice, then the effect will be dissipated.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73921726573390}} '''Shield Wall'''

If two or more ''characters'' are wielding a shield with the special ''hide behind shield'', they can form a ''shield wall''.

Every frontal attacks made against ''characters'' in a ''shield wall'' receive -1 ''MoS'', on top of any malus granted by the ''hide behind shield ''special.

While used to make a ''shield wall'', shield cannot be used to reduce attack ''hits'' for damage in their regular manner.

''Characters'' in a ''shield wall'' can only move at the speed on the slowest ''character''.

''Characters'' in a ''shield wall'' act at their regular ''initiative'' but every ''movement'' must be made at the lowest ''initiative'' amongst the party of the ''shield wall''.

'''Shrugging Off Wounds'''

A ''character ''can decide to spend their turn or part of their turn ''shrugging off wounds''. 

To do so, the player must chose a line of ''injury boxes'' with'' minor injuries'' ticked but no ''major injury''. The player than do a ''resist pain'' test with a ''difficulty level ''equals to the number of ''injury boxes'' ticked. If the roll is successful, one ''injury box'' can be unticked. In case of a complete failure, one more ''injury box'' is ticked for every loss.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73941726573390}} '''Throwing Non-Range Weapon'''

Every weapon and objects can be thrown with the ''thrown'' skills.

Every ''thrown'' attack made with a weapon or object not specifically made for throwing receive a malus. 

Small objects and weapons which can be more or less contained in one hand (knives, small rocks, tomatoes, mugs, etc) receive -1 ''MoS'' and have a ''range increment'' of 5 metres. 

Medium objects and weapons which are used with one hand (arming swords, skillets, books, etc) receive -2 ''MoSes'' and have a ''range increment'' of 4 metres.

Large objects and weapons which usually require two hands to use (great swords, chairs, pumpkins, etc) receive -3 ''MoSes'' and have a ''range increment'' of 3 metres. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73961726573390}} '''Two Weapons Fighting'''

''Characters ''equipped with a weapon in each hand can do two attacks on the same ''initiative number''.

The ''dice pool'' must be split normally. 

The second attack receive -1 ''MoS''. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc60121726573390}} '''Casting Spell'''

''Characters'' with spell casting abilities can cast spells in combat.

Casting a spell causes ''attack of opportunity''.

If attack ''hits ''are scored against a ''character'' while they are casting a spell, the casting fails.

More details on ''casting spell'' in the ''magic'' chapter. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc60141726573390}} Terrain Modifiers ===

Different types of terrain can affect combat. Terrain can hinder or advantage ''characters'' depending on the situation and on how they use the different obstacles.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc73981726573390}} '''Cover'''

Cover makes a ''character ''harder to hit.

Cover is divided in 4 categories according to how much of the ''character’s ''body is hidden. 

-¼ cover: Attacks made against a ''character'' behind this type of cover receive -1 ''MoS''.

-½ cover: Attacks made against a ''character'' behind this type of cover receive -2 ''MoSes''.

-¾ cover: Attacks made against a ''character'' behind this type of cover receive -3 ''MoSes''.

-Full cover: Attacks cannot be made against ''character'' fully covered.

It is possible that a cover apply to both opponents simultaneously.

''Character'' of different ''size'' can receive different protection from the same cover. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc74001726573390}} '''Difficult Terrain'''

Different types of terrain can hinder the ''movement'' of ''characters''.

''Difficult terrains'' are divided in four categories, according to how much they hinder movement.

-Minor impediment: Every 2 metres moved count for 3. If a ''character ''runs on such terrain, 1 ''MoS'' is used not to fall. Example: Loose rocks on the ground or large exposed tree roots.

-Medium impediment: Every metre moved on such terrain counts for 2. If a ''character ''runs on such terrain, 2 ''MoSes'' is used not to fall. Example: Muddy ground or moderately steep hill.

-Severe impediment: Every metre moved on such terrain counts for 3. If a character runs on such terrain, 3 MoSes is used not to fall. Example: Icy ground or marshy land.

-Extreme impediment: Every metre moved on such terrain counts for 4. It is impossible to run on such terrain but an ''athleticism'' or ''acrobatics'' test can increase the movement at the ''GM ''discretion. Example: Thick bush or jagged rocks. 

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc74021726573390}} '''High Ground'''

Attacking a ''character ''on lower ground gives the ''character'' on ''high ground'' +1d. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc60161726573390}} Managing Combat with Miniatures ===

In some situation it may be beneficial to use miniatures to keep track of what is happening in combat. This is specially useful in large fight with many ''characters'' or in fight taking place in complex terrain. 

Different manner of managing combat with miniatures exist, each with their advantages and inconveniences. Here are some examples.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc74041726573390}} '''He{{clear}}
[[Image:ScatterHexGrid.svgScatterHexGrid.png|center]]x Grid'''


The main advantage of hexagonal grid is that the centre of each hex is at the same distance to all surrounding hexes.

The main disadvantage of hexagonal grid is that it might be harder to come by or to create.

To simply gameplay, each hex should represent 1 metre. In that way, a ''character'' with a ''movement speed'' of 9 metres per ''round'' can move 9 hexes on normal terrain.

While playing on a hex grid, ''character'' should be facing towards one of the point of the hex they are standing in. 

Random scatter roll can be done using a six sided dice with 1 being in front of the character, slightly on the left and going clockwise.

The hexes on each side of the hex where the ''character ''stands and the whole line they make are the ''flanks''. The hexes behind the ''flanks'' line is the ''rear'' of the ''character''.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc74061726573390}} '''S{{clear}}
[[Image:ScatterSquareGrid.svgImage2.png|center]]quare Grid'''


The main advantage of the square grid is its ease of access or of creation. Anyone can create a square grid on any surface with a pen and a ruler.

The main disadvantage of the square grid is the diagonal movement being of a longer distance than the horizontal or vertical one.

One of the way to solve this is to count each diagonal as 1 square or counting every other diagonal movement as 2 meters instead of 1 metre. This does not give an exact representation but it is simpler than calculating the hypotenuse of every diagonal movement.

To simply gameplay, each square should represent 1 metre. In that way, a ''character'' with a ''movement speed'' of 9 metres per ''round'' can move 9 squares on normal terrain.

Random scatter roll can be done using an eight sided dice with 1 being in front of the character and going clockwise.

The square on each side of the ''character'' and the line they form represent the ''flanks''. The squares behind this line are the ''rear''.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc74081726573390}} '''Grid-less map'''

It is totally possible to manage combat with miniatures but without any kind of grid. The ''GM'' and ''players'' can simply agree on a measure representing 1 metre, ideally in relation to the size of the miniatures, and either use a ruler, a marked string, a divider compass or simply estimating distances by eye.

In this case, random scatter can either be rolled with a six or eight sided dice, as agreed by the group beforehand. If you where so inclined, you could even use a 12 sided dice, in the way of a clock, to roll the random scatter.

The ''flanks'' will be every position situated on an imaginary line perpendicular to the ''character ''direction. Everything behind that line is the ''rear''.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc118121283846921}} '''On the Side: Armour is Very Effective!'''

Attacking heavily armoured opponent is not an easy task. Simply slashing and poking at armour is unlikely to seriously injured an adversary.

Various forms of armour are more or less effective against certain types of attacks. For this reason, experienced fighters can often been seen carrying more than one weapon or versatile weapons like the poleaxe. 

More high-end armour, like the full plate suit designed by the Highlander Half-Men, is very expensive but render the wearer near invulnerable. 

Contrary to popular believe, such armour does not render the wearer slow or clumsy; the weight is very well distributed across the body and the joints are designed to give more mobility than needed.

When facing an opponent equipped with such an amazing defence, it is often wise to use more refine approach than simply hitting on the steel encasing them. 

One strategy could be to try to drain their ''spirits points'', either by intimidating them, demoralizing them or exhausting them. Such a tactic obviously bear the risk of having one's own ''spirit points'' depleted.

Another popular approach is to try to ''grapple'' and wrestle with the armoured opponent, trying to send them on the ground or to stab them in a vulnerable point of the armour.

Of course, some would say that the wisest strategy while facing significantly better armoured opponent would be to turn around and run away.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc60181726573390}} <span style="background-color:transparent;">'''In Short: </span><span style="background-color:transparent;">Combat'''</span>

''- ''At the start of a combat, every character roll ''initiative'': this is either a ''perception & vigilance'' or ''reflex'' test.

-Each ''round'', the ''GM'' do a countdown from the highest ''initiative'' to the lowest.

-''Characters'' act on their ''initiative'' number.

-''Characters'' with an ''initiative'' greater than 0 can decide to wait and act at the negative of their ''initiative''.

-''Characters'' with an ''initiative ''greater than 0 can also split their ''dice pool'' to perform two actions. The second action will be performed at the negative of their ''initiative''.

- A ''character'' being targeted by a ''melee combat'' attack can defend themself as a ''reaction'' by rolling a ''melee combat'' roll of their own.

-The ''MoSes'' from both rolls are compared. The ''character'' with the most ''MoSes'' win the engagement.

-The difference between the number of ''MoSes'' is the ''hits'' of the winner of the engagement.

-The ''character'' winning the engagement can spend ''hits'' to control the situation or to inflict damage.

-The control option are as follows: 

<div style="margin-left:0.499cm;margin-right:0cm;">1 ''hits:'' the ''character'' can move 1 metre inside the ''range of attacks'' of their opponent without causing ''attack of opportunity.''</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.499cm;margin-right:0cm;">''2 hits'': the ''character ''can move their opponent by 1 metre in any direction. An extra ''hit'' is required to push them off a ledge.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.499cm;margin-right:0cm;">4 ''hits'': the ''character'' can ''disarm'' their opponent. For every additional ''hit'' spent the weapon land 1 metre away in a random direction.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">- For damage, if the ''character'' scoring the ''hits ''is the attacker, they can roll 1 die of damage per ''hit.'' If they are the defender, they must spend 2 ''hits'' to get one damage die.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">- When targeted by a range attack, if they are aware of being targeted, the ''character ''can do a ''reflex ''roll to oppose the ''range combat'' roll of the attacker.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">-If the attacker score some ''hits'', they can roll one die of damage per ''hit''.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">-For both melee and range attacks, the ''MoSes'' obtained on a damage roll are compared to the armour worn by the target. </div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">-For every ''hit'' obtained on a damage roll, the target must tick one ''injury boxes''. All ''injury boxes'' must be on the same line.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">-If a player doesn’t have enough ''injury boxes'' available on one line to tick, they become incapacitated.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">-''Piercing'' damage cause 1 level of ''bleeding.''</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">-''Cutting'' damage cause 2 level of ''bleeding''.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">-When performing a ''power ''or ''agility'' action, a player must either reduce their ''dice pool'' by 1 per ''bleeding wound'' or aggravate the ''bleeding wounds ''by 1 level.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">-If a ''bleeding wounds ''of level 3 is aggravated, the ''character ''becomes incapacitated.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">-''Bludgeoning'' damage makes the target stunned. The target of the attack makes a ''resist shock'' test. On the next turn, the number of ''MoSes'' obtained on the ''resist shock'' test is the limit of the ''dice pool ''size for the next round. This limit increase by 1 per round.</div>


== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc92951283846921}} Spirit, Injuries and Health ==

Adventuring is a dangerous activity. Many situations can damage the spirit or health of a ''character'' to various extent. Thankfully, most ''injuries'' can be healed, either naturally, through ''medicine'' and ''first-aid'' or through magic. Spirit will come back after a good rest, a good time with friends, a sumptuous meal or a brilliantly performed show. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc118141283846921}} Spirit ===

Spirit represents the will to overcome obstacle of a ''character''. It is a mix between stamina and moral.

By default, the maximum number of ''spirit points'' of a ''character'' is the sum of their ''constitution'', ''sagacity'' and ''persona'' ''attributes''. Some circumstances can raise or lower the maximum ''spirit''.

Whenever a ''character’s constitution'', ''sagacity'' or ''persona'' increase, their maximum ''spirit ''will increase by the same number.

The current amount of ''spirit points'' held by a ''character'' limit the size of every ''dice pool''.

'''Using Spirit Points'''

''Spirit'' can be spent to add dice to a dice-''pool.'' 

In order to add one die to a dice-''pool the player must spend an amount of spirit points equal to the number of dice currently in the dice pool.'' 

In a round, a player can buy a number of dice equal to the rank of the ''skill'' being tested. 

''Dice pool'' for untrained ''skills'' cannot be improved by ''spirit''.

Example: A ''character'' has a ''swimming skill'' of 2. Their ''dice pool'' for a ''swimming ''test will be of 3 dice. The player decide to buy some extra dice for an important test. They buy their maximum allowed of 2 extra dice for 7 ''spirit points'', 3 for the first dice and 4 for the second. They can now make their roll with 5 dice.

'''Common Causes of Spirit Lost: Fighting'''

Every hit scored on an attack against a character cause the loss of 1 spirit point. 

If a ''character'' become ''incapacitated'' in combat, all the other ''characters'' on their side must make a ''Confidence & ego'' test. The ''difficulty level ''of this test is equal to 2 * the number of ally ''incapacitated''. The ''character'' lose 1 ''spirit point'' per missing ''MoS''.

'''Common Causes of Spirit Lost: Death of an Ally or Friend'''

If an acquaintance, friend or ally of a ''character'' dies, when this last one learn about it, they must make a ''Confidence & ego ''test. The ''difficulty level'' for this test is 2 for an acquaintance, 4 for a friend or relative and 6 for a party member or close relative.

If the relationship with the deceased was unfriendly, the ''difficulty'' is reduced by 2, meaning that no test is needed for an acquaintance and the difficulty for a party member is reduced to 4. There is no such thing as an unfriendly friend.

If the death was a violent one, the ''difficulty'' is increased by 2. If the ''character'' witness this violent death, the ''difficulty'' is increased by an additional 2.

If the death was expected, for example due to a long illness or old age, and the ''character'' had an opportunity to say good bye, the ''difficulty'' is halved.

For every missing ''MoS,'' 2 ''spirit point'' are lost.

'''Common Causes of Spirit Lost'': ''Insult and Intimidation'''

''Insult & intimidation'' can also cause lost of ''spirit points''. When a ''character'' is being intimidated they can oppose it with a ''Confidence & ego'' roll, if they are insulted they can oppose it with a ''detect motive'' roll. If the ''insult & intimidation'' scores ''hits'', the intimidated/insulted ''character'' loses 1 ''spirit points'' per ''MoSes'' on the ''insult & intimidation'' roll (not the ''hits'', the total ''MoSes'').

'''Common Causes of Spirit Lost: Long Travel'''

Long travel will also drain the ''spirit'' of a ''character''. At the end of a day with significant travel, a ''resist fatigue ''test is made. The ''difficulty'' is 1 for every 2 hours travelled. If a ''character ''has between 1 and 1½ time their ''encumbrance'' limit, the ''difficulty ''is 1 per hour travelled. If their ''encumbrance'' is more than 1½ their limit, the ''difficulty'' is raised to 1 per half-hour travelled. 

For every missing ''MoS'' 1 ''spirit point'' is lost. 

'''Common Causes of Spirit Lost: Lack of Sleep'''

''Character'' ideally needs at least 6 hours of sleep per day. If for some reason they are not able to get that much sleep in a 24 hours period, they must make a resist fatigue test. The ''difficulty'' is 1 per missing hour (or 6 – hours slept). 

For every missing ''MoS'' 1 ''spirit point'' is lost.

If the ''character'' has multiple consecutive days with insufficient sleep, the difficulty is accumulated. 

If the ''character ''is both lacking sleep and did a long travel, only one test is made but the ''difficulty'' are added.

'''Common Causes of Spirit Lost: Lack of Food'''

A ''character'' needs at least two meals a day (regular meals, feast count as two meals). At the end of a day, if a ''character'' missed meals, they must make a ''resist hunger'' test. The ''difficulty level'' of that test is equal to the number of meals skipped. 

If a ''character'' spend multiple consecutive days without having 2 meals, the ''difficulty level'' is the number of meals missed since the last time the ''character'' had their 2 meals.

For every missing ''MoS'' 2 ''spirit point'' is lost.

'''Common Causes of Spirit Lost: Extreme Weather'''

Spending a prolonged period of time in extreme heat or in extreme cold can drain someone's ''spirit''. 

Both heat and cold are separated in 3 level of inconvenience. For cold, they are: ''cold'', between 10º Celsius and 0º Celsius, ''freezing'', between 0º Celsius and -15º Celsius and ''frigid'', below -15º Celsius.

For heat, the 3 level are: ''hot'', between 30º Celsius and 40º Celsius, ''scorching'', between 40º Celsius and 50º Celsius and ''blistering'', over 50º Celsius.

For every 4 hours spent in ''cold'' or ''hot'' temperature, a ''character'' must make a ''resist cold'' or ''resist heat'' test with a ''difficulty level ''of 1 per 4 hours.

In ''freezing ''or ''scorching'' temperature, the ''difficulty level'' is 1 per 2 hours.

In ''frigid'' or ''blistering'' temperature, the ''difficulty level ''is 1 per hour.

Those difficulties accumulate. If the temperature change classification before a test is required, if the ''character'' was half-way through a test, cut the time for the test in the new classification by half.

For every missing ''MoSes'' 1 ''spirit point'' is lost and for every 2 missing ''MoSes'' 1 ''minor injury'' is gained. Additional ''MoSes'' can be used for the next test.

For example: A ''character'' is outside in ''cold'' temperature for a while. After 4 hours, they make a first test at ''difficulty'' 1. They get 3 ''MoSes'', the test is passed and 2 ''MoSes'' are saved. 2 hours later, the temperature drop to freezing, a test is not needed immediately but since the ''character'' was half-way towards his next test the next test will be in 1 hour instead of 2. So, after another hour (7 in total), a second test is needed with a ''difficulty'' of 2. Since 2 ''MoSes'' were saved from the first test, the ''character'' does not need to roll. After another 2 hours (9 hours total), the ''character'' need to roll again, the ''difficulty level ''is 3. Hopefully, they won't have to spend the night outside and will be able to get to warmth soon.

Clothing, shade and sheltering can reduce the ''difficulty'' of ''resist cold'' and ''resist heat'' test.

If a ''character'' spend a long and predetermined amount of time outside, for example of spending a night outside or doing a round of watch, to simplify the process the ''GM'' can ask for only one test at the end of the exposure time, with the final difficulty. 

'''Common Causes of Spirit Lost: Getting Drunk'''

If a ''character'' has been drinking alcohol, they might need to do a ''resist poison'' test. 

The ''GM'' should call for such a test if the ''character ''attempt to do an action requiring a test. 

The ''difficulty level'' of such a test is equal to 1 per portion of alcohol drunk. A portion of alcohol is equal to half a litre of beer, ale or cider, a quarter litre of wine or an eight of liquor. The ''difficulty level'' is the total portion of alcohol consumed since the ''character ''started drinking, until he stopped drinking for 2 hours. After those 2 hours, the ''difficulty'' is reduced by 1 and keep dropping by 1 for every hour thereafter. 

While still drinking, for every missing ''MoS'' not only 1 ''spirit point'' is temporarily lost but also ''agility'', ''power'', ''erudition'' and ''sagacity'' are reduced by 1 and 1 die is added to every ''Confidence & ego'' test, both temporarily.

After 2 hours without drinking, the character can do ''resist poison'' rolls (one every hour) to regain their ''spirit'', ''agility'', ''power'', ''erudition'' and ''sagacity. ''The ''difficulty level'' of those test is equal to the number of ''spirit points'' lost due to drinking. For every hour without drinking, 1 ''MoS'' id added to the ''resist poison'' test. For every ''hit'' 1 ''spirit'', ''agility'', ''power'', ''erudition'' and ''sagacity'', are regained and 1 ''confidence & ego'' is lost.

For example: A ''character'' drank a whole litre of whisky, 8 portions of alcohol, when somebody else wants to pick a fight with them. It is not relevant to know exactly how drunk the ''character'' is so a test is called. The ''difficulty level'' is 8 and 3 ''MoSes'' are rolled. The ''character'' lose 5 ''spirit points'' and their ''agility'', ''power'', ''erudition'' and ''sagacity'' are reduced by 5 (but they will have 5 extra dice if they need to do a ''Confidence & ego ''test). This is going to be a tough fight.

After the fight is over, the ''character'' stop drinking and try to sober up. After a 6 hours of sleep, the associate of the brawler from the night before burst into his room. Time to see how drunk the ''character'' still is. A ''resist poison'' test is made, the ''difficulty level'' being 5, 3 ''MoSes'' are rolled. 6 ''MoSes'' are added from the time spent without drinking for a total of 9 ''MoSes'', 4 ''hits''. The ''character'' regain almost all of their ''spirit'', ''agility'', ''power'', ''erudition'' and ''sagacity'', they are now only down by 1.

'''Regaining Spirit Points: Full Night of Sleep'''

When a ''character'' spend at least 6 hours of rest uninterrupted, if they do not suffer from any ''major injury'' (after any ''natural healing'' test they can make), they regain an amount of ''spirit points'' equals to half their ''constitution'' score. Sleeping in a makeshift shelter in the wild or in a cheap inn allow to double the ''spirit points'' gained. If sleeping in a luxurious bed, the amount of ''spirit points'' is tripled. 

'''Regaining Spirit Points: Victory!'''

When a fight is over, every ''character'' on the winning side not currently ''incapacitated'' or ''dead'' can do a ''Confidence & ego'' test and gain 2 ''spirit point'' per ''MoS''.

If there is no clear winning side, no such test should be allowed.

'''Regaining Spirit Points: Resounding Successes'''

Every time a player rolls a ''resounding success'' they can choose to regain 2 ''spirit point'' for every ''MoS'' on the roll instead of gaining an ''experience point'' in the ''skill ''tested.

It is not expected that this option would be commonly favoured but in some circumstances, a surge of ''spirit points'' can seem more important than ''experience points''.

'''Regaining Spirit Points: Feast'''

If lacking food drain the ''spirit'' of a ''character'', a sumptuous feast can raise it. After enjoying such a meal a ''character'' can make a ''Confidence & ego ''test and gain 2 ''spirit point'' per ''MoS''.

If the ''character'' preparing the feast rolled more ''MoS'' than needed to cover the number of guests, those ''hits'' can be distributed among guests and added to the ''Confidence & ego ''test.

'''Regaining Spirit Points: Merrymaking'''

A ''character'' can do an artistic performance to inspire and raise the moral of an audience. They roll for one of the ''speciality'' of ''arts & performance'' and distribute 2 ''spirit point'' per ''MoS'' to the members of the audience.

This test can be both ''assisted'' and ''composed ''but every roll take 20 minutes.

'''Regaining Spirit Points: Love'''

Spending intimate time with a significant one allow a ''character ''to do a ''Confidence & ego'' test and regain 2 ''spirit point'' per ''MoSes''.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc163471232709988}} Injuries ===

Every ''character'' can take a certain amount of physical punishment before becoming ''incapacitated''. This is represented by the amount of ''injury boxes'' a ''character ''possesses''.''

''Injury boxes'' are organized in line, some being ''minor'' and some ''major''. Whenever a ''character'' receive damage, they must tick a number of ''injury boxes ''equal to the level of the damage received. All those ''injury boxes'' must be on the same line. 

A player can decide (or is sometime forced) to mark the damage on a line with some ''injury boxes'' already ticked. If there is no line available with a sufficient amount of unitkced ''injury boxes'', the ''character ''becomes ''incapacitated''. 

There are two types of ''injury boxes''<nowiki>; </nowiki>''minor injury'' and ''major injury''. Whenever all the ''minor injury boxes'' on a line are ticked, any additional ''damage'' scored on the line will tick ''major injury boxes''. 

Example: A rookie guard has 2 lines of ''injury boxes'', each with 2 ''minor injury boxes'' and 1 ''major injury box''. The guard receive 1 damage, and thus tick 1 ''minor injury box ''on the first line. If they receive another point of damage, they can tick the second ''minor injury box'' on the first line or the first ''minor injury box'' on the second line. The player chose the first option. They then receive 3 damage. This have them tick their whole second line. They can now only receive 1 more point of damage before going ''incapacitated''. 

Most player's ''characters'' will start with 3 lines of ''injury boxes'', each with 3 ''minor injury boxes'' and 1 ''major injury box''. This can be noted as ''injury:(3+1)*3''. If they had 4 lines of ''injury boxes'' it would become ''injury:(3+1)*4''.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1254841251292261}} Bleeding ===

Every ''injury boxes ''line has associated with it three ''bleeding boxes''. Some ''major'' ''injuries'' cause bleeding wounds (notably ''piercing'' and ''cutting ''damage). Bleeding wound can be of 3 level. If a ''bleeding wound'' of level 3 is aggravated, the ''character'' automatically becomes ''incapacitated.''

''A character'' suffering from ''bleeding'' wounds must reduce every of their ''agility ''and ''power ''based ''dice pool'' by 1 for every ''injury boxes ''line with a ''bleeding box ''ticked. A player can decide to ignore this malus or part of it but every ''bleeding'' wounds ignored will be aggravated by 1 level.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc93250620566188}} Unconscious ===

A ''character'' can be made ''unconscious'' by blunt trauma or by being chocked. While ''unconscious'', a ''character'' cannot act nor talk and is totally unaware of what is happening around them or even of the time that pass. 

If a ''character'' receives a ''bludgeoning'' injury causing them to become ''incapacitated'', they become ''unconscious''. The ''character'' will regain consciousness after cumulating 10 ''MoSes'' on a ''resist shock'' ''step-back rolling test''. 

If a ''character'' fails a ''resist fatigue'' test to resist chocking (''difficulty level'' equal to the number of round being chocked), they become ''unconscious''. They will regain consciousness after cumulating 10 ''MoSes'' on a ''resist fatigue step-back rolling test''. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1254861251292261}} Healing Injuries and Wounds ===

After a long rest, a ''character'' has a chance to heal some injuries. For every line of ''injury boxes'' with boxes ticked, the player can do a ''natural healing ''test. For every ''MoS'', one ''box'' can be unticked, starting by the ''bleeding boxes'', then the ''major injury'' and finally the ''minor injury''.

Example: A c''haracter'' with ''injury:(3+1)*3'' suffered a ''major injury'' with ''bleeding ''level 2 and a ''minor injury''. After a long rest, the player can roll twice, once for each line. The first roll obtain 2 ''MoSes'', enough to clear the ''bleeding'' but the ''character'' remains with a ''major injury''. The second roll obtain 1 ''MoS'', just enough to clear the ''minor injury'' on the second line.

'''Medicine and First-Aid'''

''Bleeding'' can be stopped by ''first-aid'' or ''medicine''. The ''difficulty level'' is equals to the level of the ''bleeding''. ''Medicine'' can be made as a ''first-fail rolling test'' but ''first-aid'' can only be rolled as a ''static test.''

''Medicine'' can also help a ''character'' heal faster. A ''first-fail rolling test'' can be made with a ''difficulty level ''equals to the number of ''injury'' ''boxes'' and ''bleeding boxes'' ticked on a line. Every roll takes one hour. The ''hits'' on that rolled can be added to the next ''natural healing'' test done to heal that line.

Example: A character with ''injury (3+1)*3'' suffered a major injury from a cut, causing them a ''bleeding wound'' of level 2. Before going to bed, they receive help from an ally to heal their wound. The ''medicine'' test has a ''difficulty level ''of 6. The ally rolls a first time, scoring 2 ''MoSes''<nowiki>; one hour pass. </nowiki>A second roll scores 4 ''MoSes'', for a total of 6, just meeting the ''difficulty level''. A third roll and a third hour will be needed to have any effect. 3 ''MoSes ''are scored and become ''hits''. Those ''hits'' can be added on the next ''natural healing'' test for that injury line.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1254881251292261}} Incapacitated ===

When a ''character'' becomes ''incapacitated'', they cannot take action. They are still conscious but can do little more than lie on the ground, moaning. 

A ''character ''will remain ''incapacitated ''until all their ''major injuries ''are healed.

If a ''character'' becoming ''incapacitated ''suffer from ''bleeding wounds'', they start to ''bleed to death''. They will die after a number 1 minutes plus 1 minute per ''MoS'' obtained on a ''natural healing'' test.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc93252620566188}} Death ===

When a ''character ''die, an ally can try to resuscitate them with a ''first-aid static test'' or with a ''first-fail medicine fail''. The ''difficulty level'' of those test is equal to the number of minutes the ''character'' has been dead plus 1. Each roll takes 1 minute.

Each type of magic has its own way to cast spell and own risks and drawbacks.

Casting spell is done as a ''first fail rolling test'' of the appropriate ''skill''. Unless specify otherwise, every roll take one turn (approximately 6 seconds). Receiving damage while casting makes the spell fail.

The second step is usually the death by air, where the character is chocked until they become unconscious.

This is then followed by the death by fire, where the initiate is placed in the centre of a circle of fire until they lose consciousness from the heat and the smoke.

The fourth death is by earth, where the initiate is buried alive for a night.

The last step is almost always the death by aether, of the death of the soul. The ''character'' must stand in a room, with a sack on their head and cotton blocking their ear.

== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc346141813765938}} Creating a Character ==

''Character ''are mostly defined by their prior experiences. The process of ''character ''creation in ''WinterDawn'' is based on choosing backgrounds for this ''character''. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc346161813765938}} Background Defined Features ===

By choosing answers to a series of questions on the past of the ''character'', a number of ''skills ''and ''experience ''points will be made available for this ''character''. 

'''Background Points'''

Each background is associated to a cost. This cost can be related to previous background taken by the player. More unique experiences cost more than the common ones. This cost is paid with ''background points''.

Every player start with a certain amount of ''background points''. This number has to be decided by the ''GM''. A higher number of ''background points'' will allow ''characters'' with extremely unique past while a lower amount of ''background points'' will create ''characters'' with life experiences very similar to most people of their world. 

For ''character'' with some unique experiences and some common one, 25 ''background points'' would be appropriate.

'''Skill Experience'''

Each background grant experience in a few ''skills''. The number in the parenthesis following the name of the ''skill'' represent the number of ''experience points'' gained.

'''Attributes'''

The race and sub-race of the ''character'' will determine their base ''attributes'' score. Those ''attributes ''score can be improved in the normal way by spending ''attribute'' ''experience''. ''Attribute experience ''is gained from spending the ''skill experience'' gained from the background choices. For every ''skill ''rank gained 2 ''experience points'' are gained for the controlling ''attribute'' or ''attributes''. 

'''Age'''

The race of the ''character'' determine the minimum age at which they begin. The previous occupation of this ''character'' will add some years to this age. If a ''character'' picked more than one previous occupation or the same occupation multiple time, the years are added every time. 

'''Size'''

The race or sub-race of the ''character'' determine their ''size''. 

The ''size'' of a ''character ''impact multiple aspects of the game, from how hard they are to hit at range to how much equipment they can carry. 

The playable race described in this book have size varying from ''small'' to ''large''. 

'''Movement Speed'''

The ''movement'' ''speed'' of the ''character'' is determined by their race. For most ''character'' their based movement speed is 9 metres per round, 90 metres per minutes.

'''Traits'''

''Traits'' are special features allowing a ''character'' some special abilities. ''Traits'' are a big part of what make a ''character'' unique. Some of them can be purchased at ''character ''creation with ''background points'', some come are granted by a background, other can be purchased later in game and some can only be granted by the ''GM'' due to in-game events.

''Traits'' granted by a background do not need to respect the prerequisite. To purchase ''traits'' with ''background points'' or ''experience points'' the prerequisite need to be met.

Some backgrounds will allow a player to buy a ''trait'' at half price. If the player pick two background offering the same ''trait'' at half price, the ''trait'' can be purchased for free.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc93256620566188}} Values ===

Values reflect a ''character'' way of acting towards the world. They are rated on a scale counting 5 steps. 

The values of the ''characters'' are defined by their actions, not the other way around.

The rating of the values will change during play to reflect how the ''character'' has been acting. Some ''character ''backgrounds can move values one way or the other.

{{anchor|RefHeadingToc88766323286652}} '''Honour'''

Having them around is quite useful, that’s why every ''orcish ''family keep a few living on their farm.

They seem to be happy with the arrangement we have.

'''''Hobgoblins'''''

The offspring of ''goblins'' and ''orcs'', this is one the main problem with keeping ''goblins'' around.

Creating ''hobgoblins ''is highly irresponsible.

The fact that they are infertile proves they shouldn’t exist to begin with.

All that being said, the fault of the parents should not be bore by the child.

'''''Elves'''''

You can’t be more haughty than an ''elf''. 

They think they should be in charge of everyone. 

Yes they are the oldest race but their time is past.

'''''Fauns'''''

Everything is laughing matter for the ''fauns''.

Unlike the ''elves'', they seem to understand that the time of the faes is passed. 

The big ones can be quite competent in combat.

'''''Trolls'''''

The only races that can match us in combat; they’re tough as nails.

Nobody seems to like them; they are really misunderstood.

The ''highlander ''keep taking their mountains, they have reasons to be upset. 

'''Subraces'''

''Orcs ''are divided in 3 subraces.

'''''Black-Skinned'''''

''Black-Skinned orcs'' live in the desert and jungle in the south. They get their name from their dark green, almost black, complexion.

They tend to rely more on ambush tactics than others orcs and do not consider this type of approach has dishonourable.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc548941813765938}} Elf ===

''Elves'' have very smooth features, their skin colour goes from very pale, almost blueish-white, to olive colour.

Elves live in multi-level villages, located in the forest, in harmony with the plant and trees. Houses are more grown than built; trees are tutored and guided to offer adequate shelter to the elves.

Elves are the leader of the loose coalition of the faes. A lot of tension with the other races have risen in the last centuries due to the fact that the younger races expand rapidly and encroached on the wild. 

The elves are now determined to not let the younger races infringe any more on their land.

Their height vary greatly, usually between 1.45 metres to 1.95 metres. Taller and smaller individuals exist but are quite uncommon.

They know how to be satisfied with what they have.

'''''Orcs'''''

They are very aggressive towards nature and always try tom expand their farms.

Those giant boars they breed are an abomination.

They only respect strength.

'''''Goblins'''''

We must keep an eye on them, or they’re going to set the world on fire.

They are smart and creative but use their gifts in the worst way.

Their greed will damn all the races.

'''''Hobgoblins'''''

They are the best of the green-skin as they can’t reproduce.

They share the flaws of their parents.

'''''Fauns'''''

They are too lenient towards the other races.

They believe the time of the faes has passed.

They should do more to protect the wild and take the threat of the humans and green-skins more seriously.

'''''Trolls'''''

We commend their desire to protect their home, but they might be too proactive and aggressive.

''Fauns'' like to play tricks and to challenge people. They are decent craftsman but do not care about money. If they accept to trade their product they’ll usually ask for a favour or the completion of a quest. Those favour and quest will often be strange or pointless.

They mistakenly think there is a difference between nature and the non-faes.

They must understand that the other races expanding is not them destroying nature but nature changing and evolving.

Self-appointed leader of the ''faes'', at least they let us be and half control the ''trolls.''

'''''Trolls'''''

They make the same mistake as the ''elves'' but take it further by wanting to eradicate the other races.

Luckily, they still somewhat listen to the ''elves''<nowiki>; if it wasn’t the case we might have to intervene to stop them.</nowiki>

We can try to teach them lessons but nothing seems to stick.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc548981813765938}} Troll ===

Living in caves and mountains, the ''trolls'' are big, strong and very tough. Their rocky skin makes them hard to kill. Their eyes have the appearance of precious stone like ruby, emerald, amethyst and sapphire.

''Trolls'' society is very militaristic and hierarchical. The stronger fighters can climb up in ranks while the weak will forever stay at the bottom of the social ladder. 

''Trolls'' believe that the faes should be more on the offensive against the other races instead of protecting the status quo as directed by the ''elves''. If they could convince the other ''faes'' they would gladly spearhead the physical removal of the humans and green-skins from the world, or at least, forced them into much smaller territory. 

'''Raised Communally'''

''Trolls'' do not typically raise their young themselves. All the ''trolls'' children are raised together by a member of the community dedicated to this task.

This upbringing can be brutal and devoid of love. The focus of this education is to prepare the next generation of warriors. 

'''Size'''

''Trolls'' size is large.

Their height is usually between 2.15 metres to 2.6 metres. Taller and smaller individuals exist but are quite uncommon.

Their weight usually vary between 170 kilograms to 220 kilograms.

Heavier and lighter individuals exist but are quite uncommon.

'''Movement Speed'''

''Trolls'' have a ''movement speed'' of 9 metres per ''round'' or 90 metres per minute. 

They can travel 50 kilometres in a day (10 hours of travelling) without too much trouble.

'''Age'''

''Characters'' for players should not usually start any younger than 12 years old.

''Trolls'' can live up to 200 years.

'''Attributes'''

''Trolls'' are strong and very tough but not too wise and not at all inclined towards intellectual pursuit.

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">''Turning to Stone''</div>

'''Name'''

''Trolls ''use 3 parts name: the first part is the last part of their father’s name, the second is the last part of their mother’s name and the third part is original. This has for effect that brothers and sisters share the first two part of their name. Those names look like Senwe-Yamike-Okujo, Ekon-Kea-Jabir, Dorkuraz-Soljua-Zulja, Bujin-Aiko-Doubri and Dalik-Molra-Zirg.

'''Opinion of Other Races'''

''Trolls'' don’t have many relations with the other races. 

'''''High-Men'''''

They are the worst, they spread so fast, their like a disease.

Most of them don’t know how to fight.

If it wasn’t for their number, they would be easy to wipe out.

'''''Highland Half-Men'''''

They encroach directly on the place we live.

They dig and dig and destroy the mountains.

They are tougher than their size would suggest.

'''''Lowland Half-Men'''''

They are weak and squishy.

The other ''faes'' seem to like them.

We could crush them easily but the other ''faes'' would stand in our way.

'''''Orcs'''''

Proud fighters.

More restrained in their expansion than the ''high-men''.

If we were to share the land with one of the non-faes, the orcs would be the least objectionable.

'''''Goblins'''''

They are small and weak but have terrible machines of war.

We sometimes capture them to have them build those machines for us.

'''''Hobgoblins'''''

Not as proud or tough as the ''orcs''.

Not as smart and creative than the ''goblins''.

Pretty much useless.

'''''Elves'''''

They think we can just keep the status quo and that the non-faes will no longer expand in our territory.

They think they are so smart.

One day will put them in their place, and we will be the one giving direction.

'''''Fauns'''''

They think we should just let the other races replace us.

They take nothing seriously.

They need to get their head straight and protect the realm of the ''faes''.

'''Subraces'''

The ''trolls'' are divided in 4 subraces.

'''''Basalt Clan'''''

''Trolls'' from the ''basalt clan'' live deep in volcanic caves. They have a black complexion, smoother than the other ''trolls''. They serve as scout for the ''trolls'' military expedition.

''Lowlander ''villages are either set in the foothills of mountains or at the edge of forest. The culture in the ''lowlander'' villages is very laid back. The crops chosen for the field are easy to grow and require little work outside of the seeding and the harvesting seasons and animals are raise in a free-range manner, feed themselves on their own and are rounded up when needed. A lot of wild food is gathered and hunting is done year round.

''Lowlander'' village don’t have much in term of hierarchy; each village as an elected mayor and sheriff but neither of those roles seems to hold any real power or responsibilities. In some occasions, either the mayor or the sheriff will be asked to judge a dispute but a random third party is almost as likely to be asked.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1036131813765938}} Orcish Hamlet ===

''Orcs'' live in small spread out hamlet. Each ''orc'' will typically have a compound with some farmland and a few buildings. Those buildings will include a house for their family, one or more small houses where ''goblins'' reside, a workshop, a building for livestock and a building for grain storing. A hamlet will usually count between 3 to 10 of those compounds. 

Orcish society does not have geographically linked leadership. Every orc is represented by a chieftain. They are free to chose this chieftain or to themselves become a chieftain if 5 non related individuals are willing to be represented by them. People living in the same hamlet are often represented by the same chieftain living in said hamlet just out of convenience.

It is unusual to have non-green-skins family living in orcish hamlet but sometimes a wealthy ''orc ''will have a family of friend or ally living on their compound.

== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1256701251292261}} Life on the Roads ==

Adventurers constantly face dangers and hurdle while on the road. There can be all kinds of obstacles standing in the way of the ''characters''. It can be as simple as a big tree blocking a road or a more serious problem like wide river blocking the escape from a group of strong enemies. One thing is for certain, the life on an adventurer is not one of comfort.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1256721251292261}} Encumbrance ===

Adventurers need a lot of things while out on the road or deep in a dungeon. Unfortunately, what one can carry is limited. 

Every object has an encumbrance rating; this is a representation of how cumbersome the object is. Encumbrance represent both the weight and the size of an object. 

Each ''character'' has an encumbrance limit; this is the amount of material they can carry without any penalty. This limit depends on the ''power'' and ''constitution'' of the ''character'' as well as on their ''size''.

''Micro'' ''characters'' can carry their ''power'' plus their ''constitution,'' multiplied by half.

''Mini'' ''characters'' can carry their ''power'' plus their ''constitution''.

''Small'' ''characters'' can carry their ''power'' plus their ''constitution,'' multiplied by one and a half.

''Medium'' ''characters'' can carry their ''power'' plus their ''constitution,'' multiplied by two.

''Large'' ''characters'' can carry their ''power'' plus their ''constitution,'' multiplied by two and a half.

''Huge'' and larger ''characters'' can carry their ''power'' plus their ''constitution,'' multiplied by three.

A ''character ''carrying between their encumbrance limit and one and a half time their encumbrance limit suffer from a 1 die malus to all their ''power ''and ''agility'' test.

A ''character'' carrying between one and half time and two times their encumbrance limit suffer from a 2 dice malus to all their ''power ''and'' agility'' test and have their movement speed cut in half. 

A ''character ''carrying between two and three times their encumbrance limit have their movement speed reduced to 2 metres per round and can not do any ''power'' or ''agility ''test.

''Characters'' cannot carry more than 3 times their encumbrance limit.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1256741251292261}} Running ===

There are many reasons to run while adventuring. It can be running from someone or after someone, running to charge an enemy, running to reach something in a timely manner, the circumstances for running abound.

Running is divided in 3 types depending on the size and scope of the actions.

'''Sprint'''

Sprint is for the short bursts of running happening in a round. 

Sprint is done by a ''running open-ended test''. For every ''MoS ''the ''character'' can add half their movement speed to their movement.

Example: A ''character ''with a ''movement speed'' of 9 metres decide to run. The player makes a ''running ''test and obtained 3 ''successes''. The ''character ''can therefore move 23 metres (9 metres + (3 * 4.5 metres) = 22.5, rounded to 23 metres).

'''Chase'''

Chase is for the situations where a ''character ''try to catch up to another in sight and when the exact position is not that important for the gameplay.

The ''GM'' should give a number of ''MoSes'' head start for the ''character'' being chased. A good rules of thumb is 1 per 10 metres of distance from the character chasing. If the chased ''character'' start running before the chaser, the ''GM'' can add one ''running ''test to their advantage. 

Once the chase is initiated, each player do a ''running versus'' ''rolling'' ''test''. Every time the chased'' character'' scores ''hits'', they increase the distance between them and the chaser. If the chaser scores ''hits'', they distance is reduced. 

If the chaser rolls a complete failure, they lose sight of the target and the chase is over.

If the total number of ''MoSes'' obtained by the chaser is equal or greater to the number of ''MoSes'' obtained by the chased ''character'' plus their head start, the chaser catch up with his target. 

No ''character ''can make more running roll for a chase than their ''constitution ''score.

'''Pursuit'''

Pursuit is for the situation where a party is trying to catch up to another party without having a visual on them. Pursuit can last many hours or even days.

Pursuit is done as a ''versus composed test'' between the pursuer and the pursued. The pursuer makes a roll for ''running'', ''tracking'' and ''resist fatigue'' and total the number of ''MoSes''. The pursued roll for ''navigation'', ''running'' and ''resist fatigue''. The pursued can decide to replace both ''navigation'' and ''running ''with ''stealth'' if they decide to cover their tracks. If they do so, the ''tracking'' ''MoSes'' of the pursuer are halved. 

The ''GM'' determines a head start for the pursued in hours.

If the pursuer's MoSes are equal to those of the pursued, the distance between the two remain the same.

If the pursuer scores ''hits'', the distance between the two parties is reduced. Every ''hit'' allows the pursued to reduce the head start by 2 hours.

If the pursued scores ''hits'', the distance is increased. Every ''hit'' increase the head start by 2 hours.

If the pursuer have a complete failure, they lose tracks of their target.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38122197869381}} Climbing ===

When you can't go around an obstacle, nor under, nor through, going over can seem to be the solution. In order to do so you need ''climbing''. 

''MoSes'' on a ''climbing ''test represent the distance climbed with the roll. Different types of surfaces represent different level of challenge to climb. Here are a few of the most common time of climbing and how they affect the rolls.

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Tree: '''The ''character'' can climb 1 metre per ''MoS''.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Rough natural cliff'': '''''1 MoS is needed not to fall. For every 2 ''MoSes'' the ''character'' can climb 1 metre.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Smooth Cliff or Rough Wall'': '''''1 ''MoS'' is needed not to fall. For every 3 ''MoSes'' the ''character'' can climb 1 metre.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Smooth Wall: '''1 ''MoS'' is needed not to fall. For every 4 ''MoSes'' the ''character'' can climb 1 metre.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">Complete failure makes the ''character'' fall and receive fall damage as described below.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">A wet surface, strong winds or other adverse conditions can add to the number of ''MoSes'' needed not to fall.</div>

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38124197869381}} Jumping ===

Whether a ''character'' wants to traverse a chasm or just want to get on top of a table quickly, jumping is bound to happen while adventuring.

'''Horizontal Jumping'''

The distance a ''character'' can jump horizontally depends on the movement used before the jump.

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''No movement used:''' Can jump 1 metre plus 1 metre for every 3 ''MoSes''.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Half movement used:''' Can jump 1 metre plus 1 metre for every 2 ''MoSes''.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''All movement used:''' Can jump 1 metre plus 1 metre for every ''MoS''.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''All movement used plus running:''' Can jump 1 metre plus 1 metre for every ''MoS''. Can add 1 die to the ''jumping dice pool'' for every ''MoS'' used for ''running''.</div>

'''Vertical Jumping'''

A ''character ''can jump vertically half a metre plus half a metre for every 3 ''MoSes''. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38126197869381}} Moving Heavy Objects ===

Placing heavy objects in the way of a ''character'' can be a good way to slow them down. Blocking a road with a big tree, lowering down a portcullis, rolling a boulder in front of the entrance of a cave, all those situations require moving heavy objects.

'''Lifting'''

A ''character ''can lift 45kg plus 45kg per ''MoS''.

'''Pushing'''

For a flat object or an object which cannot roll, the ''character'' can push 45kg + 45kg per ''MoS''.

For an object which can roll, the ''character'' can push 90kg plus 90kg per ''MoS''.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38128197869381}} Swimming ===

When a ''character ''end up in water, no test is needed to stay afloat. To move around in water with speed, a ''swimming'' test maybe asked by the ''GM''. The ''character'' can move half their ''movement speed'' plus 1 metre per ''MoS''. 

If the ''character ''is in running water, the current might takes them in a direction at a certain number of metre per rounds. This can work for or against the ''characters''.

If the ''character'' carry a lot of material, the ''GM'' can ask for a test to stay afloat. 1 ''MoS'' would be needed if the ''character'' carry more than half their ''maximum encumbrance'', 2 ''MoSes'' if they carry more than their ''maximum encumbrance'', 3 ''MoSes'' if they carry more than one and a half times their ''maximum encumbrance'', etc.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38130197869381}} Falling ===

Falling is bound to happen while adventuring. It could be from a dangerous pit trap or simply from clumsiness. 

The damage taken from falling depends on the height of the fall and on the size of the creature.

For every metre fallen after the first one, one die of damage should be rolled. The type of dice to be rolled is a function of the size of the ''character'':

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Micro:''' d4</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Mini:''' d4</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Small:''' d6</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Medium: '''d8</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Large:''' d10</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Huge and larger:''' d12</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">The type of damage is ''bludgeoning'' and is reduced by protection worn by the ''character''.</div>

'''Acrobatics'''

A falling ''character ''can make an ''acrobatics'' test to try to land and reduce damage taken. For every ''MoS'' on this test, the dice pool for falling damage is reduced by one.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc38132197869381}} Camping ===

When making camp for a long rest, a few steps are needed to have the full benefit from a good night of sleep.

'''Sheltering'''

Sheltering is preparing a camp for the night, to grant minimum comfort to the sleeping ''characters''. It includes making a fire and creating a temporary shelter.

For every ''MoS'' on a ''step-back rolling test'', one ''character ''can be sheltered. Every roll takes 1 hour.

Sheltered ''characters'' gain twice as much ''spirit points'' from sleeping.

'''Getting Food and Cooking'''

When sleeping in the wild, a ''character'' can make a ''foraging & hunting step-back rolling test''. Each roll takes one hour. Every ''MoS'' can feed one person.

A ''character'' can take foraged food and make a feast out of it. For every ''MoS'' on a c''ooking'' ''step-back rolling test'', 2 portions of food are expended and one person is fed. Every ''character'' fed can make a ''confidence & ego'' test and regain 1 ''spirit points'' per ''MoS''. ''Hits'' on the ''cooking ''test'' ''can be distributed amongst the participant of the feast and added to the result of their ''confidence & ego ''test.

'''Merrymaking'''

One or more ''character'' can participate in merrymaking. To do so, they roll any speciality of ''arts & performance'' as a ''step-back rolling open-ended test. ''For every ''MoS'', one participant or spectator of the ''merrymaking'' can regain 2 ''spirit points.''

'''Standing Guard'''

Camping in the wild is not always the safest thing to do. For that reason, a party will often have somebody standing guard.

At the start of a guard watch, the player must make a ''perception & vigilance'' test and a ''resist fatigue'' test. For every hour spent on watch, one ''MoS'' is subtracted from the ''resist fatigue'' or ''perception & vigilance'' test. 

If ''character ''tries to sneak on the party, their ''stealth'' is compared to the current ''perception & vigilance'' of the watch.

'''Sleeping'''

This is usually the main reason to make camp. After 6 hours of sleep, a ''character'' can make a ''natural healing'' test for every lines of injury with a difficulty'' level'' equals to the number of ''injury boxes'' ticked on that line. If the test is successful, one ''injury box'' on that line is unchecked. For every hit, one additional box on the same line can be unchecked. 

If the ''character'' is uninjured (after any ''natural healing ''test), they can regain half their ''constitution'' worth of ''spirit points''. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1256761251292261}} Travelling ===

Being on the road is generally to get somewhere. 

To abstract long travel, the party can do a ''navigation ''test with a ''difficulty level'' equals to the number of days the trip should take. For every missing ''MoS'', the trip takes an extra day. This test can be assisted. Circumstances can modify the ''difficulty level ''of this test; following a road, a stream or a coast will halve the ''difficulty level'' while crossing a desert or a forest will double it.

Each'' character'' must also do a ''resist fatigue'' test with a ''difficulty level'' equals to the actual number of days travelled. For every missing ''MoS'', 2 ''spirit point'' is lost.

The ''GM ''can decide to interrupt the travel with one or more encounters. 

'''Maps'''

Each map come with a precision score. If the party possesses a map of the region they are travelling in, they can add to their navigation test the precision score of the map.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1256781251292261}} Hiding and Sneaking Around ===

When a ''character'' desire to hide, a ''stealth open-ended test'' is made. S''tealth'' tests are opposed by ''perception & vigilance'' tests. In case of a tie, the hidden ''character ''remains hidden if the opponent is not actively looking for hidden ''character'' but is discovered if the opponent is actively looking.

Example: A thief hiding from unaware passer-by will have the advantage and win tie. If a guard on duty then pass, the guard will have the advantage and win the tie.

If a hidden ''character'' try to move without being seen, the'' MoS'' from their ''stealth ''test is reduced by 1 every time they move half their ''movement speed''. Once they are done moving, they can make another ''stealth'' test to hide in their new position if they so desire.

Example: A thief roll to hide from a guard and score 4 ''MoSes''. The ''GM ''rolls for the guard secretly and scores 2 ''MoSes''. The thief then wants to move 9 metres to a new hiding spot, their whole ''movement speed''. The stealth score of the thief is therefore reduced by 2 and equals the result of the guard. Since the guard is actively looking for intruder, they win the tie. The thief is caught.

The ''GM ''can decide to grant environmental bonus and malus to either the ''character'' hiding or to those spotting them. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1256821251292261}} Extreme Weather ===

Adventuring can often bring ''character'' in location with extreme weather conditions. Being in such inhospitable environments can take a toll on the spirit of an adventurer.

The longer a ''character'' spends in extreme weather the more they are likely to suffer from exposure. There are 3 levels of extreme weather for cold and 3 levels for warmth. 

A ''character'' spending a prolonged time in extreme weather must make either a ''resist cold'' or ''resist heat'' test. The ''difficulty level ''of this test depends on the time spent and the level of weather. The ''difficulty ''is cumulative. For every missing ''MoS,'' the ''character'' lose 1 ''spirit point'', for every 2 missing ''MoSes'', the ''character ''suffer a minor injury.

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Cold:''' Below 10º Celsius; ''Difficulty level ''1 per 2 hours.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Freezing:''' Below 0º Celsius; ''Difficulty level'' 1 per hour.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Frigid:''' Below -15º Celsius; ''Difficulty level'' 1 per ½ hour.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Hot:''' Above 30º Celsius; ''Difficulty level ''1 per 2 hours.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Scorching:''' Above 40º Celsius; ''Difficulty level ''1 per hour.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Blistering:''' Above 50º Celsius; ''Difficulty level'' 1 per ½ hour.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">Example: A ''character ''is in cold temperature for 2 hours. They must make a test with a ''difficulty level'' of 1. After another 2 hours, another test is required with a ''difficulty level'' of 2. The temperature then drop to freezing. After 1 hour, a new test is needed with a difficulty level of 3.</div>


== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1256841251292261}} Cities, Towns and Civilization ==

In some case, civilization represent a comforting respite, in other, it can be more dangerous than the most remote wilderness. Some ''characters'' will thrive in such environment while others will try to spend as little time as possible in cities and towns.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1256861251292261}} Commerce ===

Commerce is often the heart of civilization. Characters need gears and equipment to go on adventures and need to unload treasure they gained on previous endeavour, therefore, they will have to deal with merchants.

'''Appraising'''

Before trying to sell an object, it is useful to estimate its price. To do so, an ''appraise'' test is made. This test can be ''assisted, halved''. The difficulty'' level'' for this test depends on the rarity of the objects:

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Common every day items:''' 0 (Food items, regular clothes, farming tools, utensils, etc)</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Specialised items:''' 1 (Weapons, armour, traps, musical instruments, etc)</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Luxurious common items:''' 2 (Fancy clothes, decorated utensils or tools, etc)</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Luxurious specialised items:''' 3 (Decorated weapons or armour, decorated musical instruments, etc)</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Art objects:''' 4 (Sculpture, painting, tapestry, etc)</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Identified magical items:''' 5 (magical weapons, magical armour, magical musical instruments, etc)</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">It is impossible to ''appraise'' an unidentified magical item. Magic user can identify a magical item with the ''identify ''spell.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">For every missing ''MoS'' on an ''appraise'' test, the ''character'' underestimate the value of the object they want to sell (unless they have the greed trait which make them overestimate the price) or overestimate the value of an object they want to acquire (again, inverted if greedy).</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''1 missing MoS:''' Off by ¼</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''2 missing MoS:''' Off by ½</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''3 missing MoS:''' Off by ¾</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''4 or more missing MoS: '''Believe the object to be worthless or invaluable.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">If a lot of item is to be ''appraised'', the ''difficulty level ''is of the rarest object. </div>

'''Haggling'''

Ounce a ''character'' has an idea, good or bad, of the price of an item, they can try to haggle for it. Haggling is done by a ''charm & persuasion'' ''opposed'' ''test''. Each ''character ''must have an estimated value of the objects. The rolls will determine the final price of the transaction the two party agree upon. 

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''In case of tie''', the final price is halfway through both estimated values.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''If the seller scores 1 ''hit''''', the final price is about ¾ towards the highest of both estimates.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''If the seller scores 2 ''hits''''', the final price equals the highest of both estimates.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''If the seller scores 3 ''hits''''', the final price equals 1½ time the highest estimates.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''If the seller scores 4 ''hits ''or more''', the final price equals 2 time the highest estimates.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''If the buyer scores 1 ''hits''''', the final price is about ¾ towards the lowest of both estimates.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''If the buyer scores 2 ''hits''''', the final price equals the lowest of both estimate.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''If the buyer scores 4 ''hits'' or more''', the final price equals ½ of the lowest of both estimates.</div>

Although it is customary, no ''character'' is ever forced to haggle; they can decide to simply pay the asking price or sell for what is offered.

If more than one objects is purchased, the appraisal and the haggling should only be done ounce for the lot.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1256881251292261}} Inns ===

Having a comfortable bed for the night can be one of the most soothing thing after many night on the road. Having a long rest in an inn triple the amount of ''spirit point'' gained (half ''constitution'' times 3). If the inn is particularly sumptuous, the ''spirit ''gained from a long rest is quadrupled.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1256901251292261}} Taverns ===

Spending time in a tavern, drinking, eating and singing, can be a good way for ''characters'' to relax and take their mind of the hardship of adventuring. One must be careful with alcohol though, abusing it will affect their ''attributes''.

Alcoholic beverages does not all have the same alcohol content<nowiki>; it will require a different amount of different drinks to consume one portion of alcohol.</nowiki>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Beer, Cider and Ale:''' ½ litre represent one portion of alcohol.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Wine:''' ¼ litre represent one portion of alcohol.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Spirit:''' ⅛ litre represent one portion of alcohol.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">When a ''character ''has been drinking, whenever it is relevant to know how affected they have been, a ''resist poison'' test should be made. The ''difficulty level ''of this test is equals to the number of portion of alcohol the ''character'' drank. For every missing ''MoS'', the ''character'' lose 1 points of ''agility'', ''power'', ''erudition'' and ''sagacity'' and gain 1 rank in ''confidence & ego''. Those modifications are temporary and will disappear as the ''character ''sober up.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">To sober up, a ''character'' must first stop drinking. Whenever it is relevant to know up much to sobered up, the player can roll a ''resist poison'' test with a ''difficulty level'' equals to the number of portion of alcohol consumed minus 1 per hour since the last drink. For every ''hit'', the ''character'' regain 1 point of ''agility'', ''power'', ''erudition'' and ''sagacity'' and lose 1 rank of ''confidence & ego'', until the effect of the alcohol are dissipated.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">Example: A ''character'' drank 1 litres of beer and half a litre of spirit, making it 6 portions. They rolled a ''resist poison ''test and scored 3 ''MoSes'', missing 3 to reach the ''difficulty level''. Their ''agility'', ''power'', ''erudition'' and ''sagacity'' is reduced by 3 and their ''confidence & ego'' is increase by the same amount. </div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">4 hours after the last drink, it is relevant to know how drunk the ''character'' is. The ''difficulty ''of a ''resist poison ''test is now 2 (6-4). They scores 3 ''MoSes'', giving them 1 ''hit''. The ''character'' regain 1 point of ''agility'', ''power'', ''erudition'' and ''sagacity'' and lose 1 rank of ''confidence & ego''. </div>

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1256921251292261}} Pickpocketing ===

Sometime, acquiring something in a legitimate way is impossible or unpleasant; in those situations a ''character'' can try to pickpocket the holder of the desire items.

To pickpocket, a ''character'' must see the item to be stolen. The thief makes a ''sleight of hand'' test against a ''perception & vigilance'' test from the target. In case of a tie the target detect the attempt, unless they are being actively distracted by a third ''character''. 

Half the object encumbrance (rounded down) is added to the ''perception & vigilance'' roll of the target.

Example: A thief tries to steal a dagger from a noble. An accomplice of the thief make a scene to distract the noble, giving the advantage to the thief. The noble rolls ''perception & vigilance ''and obtained 2 ''MoSes''. The dagger has an encumbrance of 1 and ½ rounded down equals 0 so, no bonus is added. The thief must roll 2 or more ''MoSes'' on a ''sleight of hand ''test to be successful. They roll 1 ''MoS''<nowiki>; the thief get caught!</nowiki>

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1256941251292261}} Picking Locks ===

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">To pick a lock, a ''character ''must make a ''sleight of hand first-fail rolling test ''against the ''difficulty level ''of the lock. Each roll take 1 round. </div>

<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;">A ''character'' must have a lockpick to attempt to pick a lock. In case of a ''complete failure'' on one of the rolls, the lockpick breaks.</div>

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc88786323286652}} Diseases ===

Cities, with their high population density, are the perfect environment for the spread of diseases.

When exposed to a contagious disease, a ''character'' must make a ''natural healing'' test to resist contracting this disease. The ''difficulty level'' depend on the disease. It is noted as the ''contagiousness''. 

If the test is failed, the ''character'' become afflicted by the disease. When suffering from a disease, a ''character'' can do a ''natural healing step-back rolling test'' with one roll per day to try to recover from the disease. An ally can assist the recovery with ''medicine ''test. The ''MoSes'' are added to the ''natural healing'' test. Each ''medicine'' roll take one hour. Only one roll per day can be made. The ''difficulty level'' to recover from the disease is noted as ''recovery''.

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc93264620566188}} Poison ===

When a ''character'' want to cause harm to someone but would rather avoid direct confrontation, they can use poison. 

A poisoned ''character'' can do a ''resist poison step-back rolling test'' to shrug off the effect. Each poison have a'' frequency'' at which the target can roll for'' ''their ''resist poison'' test and where the effect is going to be applied. Each poison also have a ''difficulty level'' to be attained to shrug it off.

For example, a ''character ''is poisoned with slow acting poison with a ''frequency'' of 1 day and a ''difficulty level'' of 8. After 1 day of the poison being administrated, the ''character'' makes a ''resist poison'' test and scored 3 ''MoSes''. Since the ''difficulty level ''is not met, the effect of the poison is applied. The next day, the ''character'' gets to roll again and score 2 ''MoSes'', for a total of 5. Still, the ''difficulty level'' is not met so the effect is applied a second time. On the third day, the ''character'' rolls 3 ''MoSes'', for a total of 8. The ''difficulty level ''is met, the poison lose its effectiveness.

Poison can be administrated orally or through the bloodstream, usually by coating a blade.

'''Long Boiled Slug Spit'''

== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1159621958929371}} Delving into Caves and Dungeons ==

Whether it is to find long-lost treasure or to fight some villains and monster who took residence there, adventurers are often drawn to all kind of deep caves and forgotten ruins. 

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc93266620566188}} Low Light and Darkness ===

Being in low light or in darkness can be a factor in many situations, from fighting to simply finding your way.

''Characters'' are considered in low light if they are outside at night on a full night moon, if they are in a cave with a candle, or in similar situations.

''Characters'' are considered in darkness if they are outside, on a cloudy moonless night, in a cave without a light or in similar situations. 

Every test relying on sight made while in low light receive -1 ''MoS''. This malus is increased to -2 ''MoSes'' if in darkness.

'''Torches, Lanterns and Candles'''

When venturing in the dark, it is a good idea to bring a light source. Each type of light source have their own characteristic.

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Candles:''' Typical candles last for 5 hours and give low light to up to a 5-metres radius. They are blown out fairly easily and can't stay lit in the rain.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Torches:''' They last for about 1 hours and give light to a radius of 5 metres and low light for an additional 5 metres. They cannot stay lit in heavy rain.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Lantern:''' Lantern last for up to 5 hours. They function on oil and can be recharged. They give light to a radius of up to 5 metres plus an additional 5 metres of low light.</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Bullseye Lantern:''' Bullseye lantern last for up to 5 hours. They function on oil and can be recharged. They emit a cone of light 10 metres long plus an additional 5 metres of low light.</div>

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1159641958929371}} Traps ===

When locks are not enough, traps can be used to punish would be intruders.

Every laid traps come with three ''difficulty level''<nowiki>; the first one is to detect the trap, the second one to</nowiki> understand it and the last to disarm it.

'''Spotting Traps'''

Traps can be spotted by a ''perception & vigilance'' test against the ''detection'' ''difficulty ''of the trap. This ''difficulty'' often comes from a ''stealth'' test from the person who laid the trap. If the ''character'' is actively looking for a trap, they have the advantage, if not, on a tie they fail to detect the trap. This ''perception & vigilance'' test is not a free action; if the ''character ''is doing something else requiring a roll, the number of dice used is subtracted from the ''perception & vigilance'' roll.

'''Disarming Traps'''

Once a trap is detected, a ''character'' can try to disarm it. They must first understand the trap. To do, they must roll a ''mechanics'' ''step-back rolling test'' against the trap's ''complexity''. Each roll takes one round. 

Once they understood the trap, they can actually try to disarm it. Each trap has a way of being disarmed''<nowiki>;</nowiki>'' the ''skill'' to be used and the ''difficulty level'' will be detailed in the trap description. The disarm process is always a ''first-fail rolling test''. In case of failure, the trap is sprung and get the ''character'' trying to disarm it.

'''Pit Trap'''

A simple hole in the ground covered with leaves and branches or frail planks of wood.

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Detection:''' ''Stealth ''-1 ''MoS''</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Complexity:''' 0</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Disarm:''' ''Lifting & pushing'', ''difficulty level'' 6</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Effect:''' To be effective, the trap must be at least 1 metres deep. Any ''character'' falling inside suffer fall damage. </div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">Spike can be placed at the bottom of the pit, doubling the number of dice rolled for damage and changing the type to ''piercing''. </div>

'''Bear Trap'''

Steel toothed jaws that will bite anyone stepping on them.

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Detection:''' ''stealth''</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Complexity:''' 2</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Disarm:''' ''Sleight of hand'', ''difficulty level ''3</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Effect: '''The ''character'' receive 2d8 ''piercing damage''. If the bear trap is linked to a chain, the ''character'' is restrained by this chain.</div>

'''Spring Propelled Darts'''

Dissimulated in small hole in a wall, statue or furniture, those darts will automatically be shot at any ''character'' triggering the trap.

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Detection: '''''Stealth''</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Complexity: '''6</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Effect:''' Darts fly in direction of the ''character'' triggering the trap. This has the effect of a range attack against the character. The attack is of 3d8, any ''hits'' cause 1d6 ''piercing'' damage.</div>

'''Poisonous Needle'''

Hidden directly in a lock, the poisonous needle will stab anyone trying to pick the lock without disabling the trap first.

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Detection:''' 4</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Complexity:''' 8</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Complexity: '''3</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Disarm:''' 6</div>

<div style="margin-left:0.864cm;margin-right:0cm;">'''Effect:''' Ounce the trap is sprung, all the door of the room get locked and the wall start moving at a speed of 1 metre per round. Ounce the wall start moving, it is too late to disarm the trap. At this point, the only hope of the ''characters ''is to unlock one of the door and escape.</div>

=== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1159661958929371}} Narrow Bridges and Ledges ===

Getting around in a cave or a dungeon in ruined is not always a simple affair. Deep chasm, wild river, pungent ooze or flowing lava can all be found in those inhospitable environments. To avoid or cross those obstacles, adventurers sometime have no better option than a narrow bridge or ledge.

To move on such a narrow surface, an ''acrobatics first-fail rolling test'' is required. For every ''MoS'' on this test, the ''character ''can move 1 metre. In case of the failure, the ''character ''falls. Each roll takes 1 round.

A wet or slippery surface will subtract 1 ''MoS'' per roll.


<div style="margin-left:0cm;margin-right:0cm;"></div>

== {{anchor|RefHeadingToc1256981251292261}} Equipment ==

Adventuring is a risky business and one would be a fool to undertake such an occupation without the proper equipment. 

One can never know for sure what will be needed while questing, there are some staples you should never venture without but there is only so much that can be carried; choices have to be made.

In order to have an interesting game, the ''GM ''needs to offer challenge to the other players. One common type of challenge for the players to overcome is combat.

For combat to remain interesting and challenging over time, it is important to vary the type of opponents and antagonists. To help the ''GM ''propose a wide variety of enemies, here is a list of different beasts, monsters, villains and other ''character'' (regrouped by general family or type) to stand in the way of the player. 

More ''characters'' will be offered on the WinterDawn website (WinterDawnRPG.com) overtime. Feel free to visit the online bestiary if you do not find what you desire in those pages. 

Any ''GM'' can also create their own monsters, either by modifying the one present in this book or from the WinterDawn website or from scratch by picking and choosing ''attributes'', ''skills'', ''traits'' and equipment appropriate for the creature being designed.
