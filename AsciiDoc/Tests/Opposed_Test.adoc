[lexicWord]#Opposed tests# are used when two [lexicWord]#characters# are working against each other.

A roll is made for each [lexicWord]#character#.
The roll with the most [lexicWord]#MoSes# wins.
The difference between the two results gives the number of [lexicWord]#hits# scored by the victor.

If both [lexicWord]#characters# roll the same number of [lexicWord]#MoSes#, the status quo is preserved.

In some circumstances, it is impossible or unclear to determine the status quo.
In those occurrences, prior to the rolls are made, the [lexicWord]#GM# will declare one of the [lexicWord]#characters# has having the [lexicWord]#advantage#; this [lexicWord]#character# will win the [lexicWord]#opposed test# in case of a tie.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A rogue tries to sneak in a manor.
Their [lexicWord]#stealth# test will be opposed by a [lexicWord]#perception & vigilance# made by the [lexicWord]#characters# who could spot him.
The guards expecting intruders and looking for them will have [lexicWord]#advantage# on their tests while the rogue will have [lexicWord]#advantage# when opposed by the unsuspecting occupants of the manor.
