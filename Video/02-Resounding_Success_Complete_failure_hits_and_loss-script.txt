Hello, my name is Max Boivin and I am the creator of WinterDawn RPG

Today we will look at resounding success, complete failure, hits, and losses. 

When rolling for a test, two special outcomes can happen: The resounding success and the complete failure.

A resounding success happen if the task is successful and if a single roll give as many moses as the number of dice available in the dice pool.

In case of a resounding success, the character can either regain spirit points or gain experience for the skill rolled.

A complete failure is when a single roll gives a negative number of MoSes, when more 1 are rolled than the number of MoSes rolled. 

When a complete failure is rolled, the player must rolled a confidence and ego test with a difficulty level equals to 1 plus the number of negative success.  

If this confiedence and ego test is successful, the character can gain 1 experience point in the skill failed.  

If the confidence and ego test is failed, the character lose 1 spirit point per rank in the skill failed.

hits are MoSes over the difficulty level.

Hits often come with special effects.

Some tasks will necessitate hits to have any real effect.

Losses are the negative moses, when you roll more 1s than MoS.

In an opposed test, losses are added to an opponent roll.

Losses can also imply a complication on top of the task being a failure.

For example, losses on a damage roll will lead to the weapon used being damaged.
