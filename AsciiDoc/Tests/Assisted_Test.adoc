[lexicWord]#Characters# will have a lot of opportunity to collaborate on arduous exercise.
In those situations, every [lexicWord]#player# will make a roll and the [lexicWord]#MoSes# are aggregated to beat the [lexicWord]#difficulty level#.

The [lexicWord]#GM# can put a limit on the number of [lexicWord]#characters# who can effectively work on a task.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A big fallen tree is blocking a road the [lexicWord]#characters# are travelling on.
They are going to all work together to free the way.
The tree being big enough, everybody can contribute fully.
All their [lexicWord]#MoSes# will be added together to beat the [lexicWord]#difficulty level#.

== Assisted Test, Halved

In some situations, a [lexicWord]#character# can assist an other but at reduce efficiency.
For those instances, a [lexicWord]#halved assisted test# can be performed.

One [lexicWord]#character# will be designed as the main actor; his [lexicWord]#MoSes# will be counted fully.
For the other [lexicWord]#characters# assisting, one [lexicWord]#MoS# will be tallied for every two [lexicWord]#MoSes# rolled.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A thief is attempting to disarm a trap.
The [lexicWord]#GM# decides that due to the nature of the trap, one [lexicWord]#character# can assist but halved.
