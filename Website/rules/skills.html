<h1>Skills</h1>

<p>Skills are a big part of what defines a character.  They are the interface with which the character interacts with the world around them.<br><br>
Skills can be used in many way, to overcome many different type of obstacles.  It may sometime seems obvious which skill to use in a certain situation but a player can always think outside the box and take a different approach to solve the problem at hand.  <br><br>
Skills (and attributes) can also give information about how the character should be (role) played; a character with a high Confidence & ego will act differently than one with no ranks in this skill.<br><br>
In the following chapter, each skill is going to be briefly described and given some example of use.  Like everything in this book, those are simply guidelines and should not limit the players or GM in the way they want to use the skills.  <br><br>
The skills are presented in alphabetical order.  The associated attribute(s) is indicated in on the first line.</p>
