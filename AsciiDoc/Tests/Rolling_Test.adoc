Some tasks are complex and can be worked on over a long period of time; this is what [lexicWord]#rolling tests# are for.
Those tests can have higher [lexicWord]#difficulty level# and be achieved in multiple rolls.
Each roll will represent a certain amount of time passed, depending on the type of undertaking.

There are two types of [lexicWord]#rolling test#: [lexicWord]#first fail# and [lexicWord]#setback#.

== First Fail Rolling Test

A [lexicWord]#first fail rolling test# allows the [lexicWord]#player# to keep rolling and adding their [lexicWord]#MoSes# until one roll get no [lexicWord]#MoSes#.
At that point, all the previous [lexicWord]#MoSes# are lost.

.Example

====
Picking a lock would require a [lexicWord]#first fail rolling test#.
The lock will have a [lexicWord]#difficulty level# assigned to it.
For every roll, a round passes.
If a roll obtains no [lexicWord]#MoSes# before the thief reaches the [lexicWord]#difficulty level#, he will have to start over from 0.
====

== Setback Rolling Test

A [lexicWord]#setback rolling test# does not fail upon a roll with no [lexicWord]#MoSes#.
The [lexicWord]#character# simply fails to progress.

====
A woodworker is building a cart.
Every day they can make a [lexicWord]#Woodworking# roll.
If on a day they score some [lexicWord]#loses#, they not only make no progress on that day but damage something they already built.
