:description: This is the description of opposed test.
include::../Include.adoc[]

An [lexicWord]#opposed test# is one where two [lexicWord]#characters# are working against each other for the completion of a task.

A roll is made for each [lexicWord]#character#.
The difference between those rolls become the number of [lexicWord]#hits# scored by the [lexicWord]#characters# with the most [lexicWord]#MoSes#.

[lexicWord]#Losses# are added to the [lexicWord]#hits# of the winning party.

If both [lexicWord]#characters# roll the same number of [lexicWord]#MoSes#, the status quo is preserved.

In some circumstances, it is impossible or unclear to determine the status quo.
In those occurrences, the [lexicWord]#GM# should determine if one of the [lexicWord]#characters# has the [lexicWord]#advantage#; this [lexicWord]#character# will win the [lexicWord]#opposed test# in case of a tie.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A rogue tries to sneak in a manor.
Their [lexicWord]#stealth# test will be opposed by a [lexicWord]#perception & vigilance# made by the [lexicWord]#characters# who could spot him.
The guards expecting intruders and looking for them will have [lexicWord]#advantage# on their tests while the rogue will have [lexicWord]#advantage# when opposed by the unsuspecting occupants of the manor.
