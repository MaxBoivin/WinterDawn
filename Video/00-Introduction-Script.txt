Hello, my name is Max Boivin and I am the creator of WinterDawn RPG

What is WinterDawn RPG?

At its base, WinterDawn is a medieval fantasy role playing game.

It is a classless , leveless system where your skills and traits define who you are and what you can do.

It's a game where the hardships encountered by the characters can take a toll on their moral and mechanically impact their performance.

In WinterDawn, the combats are tactical, dynamic, and always full of choices and trade offs.

Damage is not to be taken lightly in WinterDawn; Injuries have consequences and life can often hang by a thread.

WinterDawn introduces a new dice mechanics giving a real tactile feedback of the odds of success to the player.

The game also includes 6 types of magic, each with their own sources of power and cost to use.

And why create a new RPG system?

Well, over the years, I have played and read many gaming systems.

A lot of them are very good, full of good ideas but all come with some drawbacks.

WinterDawn was my attempt take my favourite ideas from my favourite games and mix them together in a single game.

I did also throw in some of my original ideas I came up with over my 20 years of roleplaying experience.

I wanted winterdawn to be easy to learn and hard to master; I made a real effort to keep the game homogenized but to keep some richness and depth.

You basically have one core mechanic to learn but it will always be surrounded by choices. 

I'd like you to take a look at WinterDawn and try it.

It can be learnt very quickly and can provide you with hours of imaginative fun.
