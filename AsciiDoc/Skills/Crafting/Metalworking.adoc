Be it forging a simple horseshoe, a golden ring, a whole set of armour or a sharp weapon, it is all done with the [lexicWord]#metal working skill#.
Repairs or modifications of such objects are also done with the [lexicWorld]#skill#.

== Creating a Metal Object

// a competent character should be able to create a simple metal object in a few minutes (a hook, a horseshoe, a nail), a slightly more complex item in a couple hours (an axe, a tool, a hinge) and a complex object in a couple of days (a sword or a piece of armour).  Samll simple object should be done by a roll during an hour, the number of MoSes indicate how many have been produced.  For more complex objects, the roll should last half a day.  Maybe the solution is to allow to multiply the MoSes by the number of hours the roll takes.  If I do this, I'll need to include this mechanics in previous task.

== Reparing a Damaged Object
