[lexicWord]#Composed test# are tests which require two or more rolls made with different [lexicWord]#skills#.
The [lexicWord]#MoSes# are added together to beat the [lexicWord]#difficulty level#.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
Disabling a trap can be made with a [lexicWord]#composed test# of [lexicWord]#mechanics#, to understand the trap design, and [lexicWord]#sleight of hands#, to disable it without triggering it.
====

== Rolling Composed Test

In some case, a test is both composed and rolling.

In such a situation, the [lexicWord]#skills# involved are alternated.

At least one roll of each [lexicWord]#Skill# must be made.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
Picking a lock will require [lexicWord]#mechanics# to understand the lock and [lexicWord]#sleight of hand# to pick it.
Difficult lock will have high [lexicWord]#difficulty level# and will require multiple roll.
The [lexicWord]#player# will have to alternate between [lexicWord]#mechanics# and [lexicWord]#sleight of hand# every roll, until the lock is unlocked or until they fail the roll.
