[lexicWord]#Group tests# are used for situations where multiple allied [lexicWord]#characters# are simultaneously performing the same task.
Part of the [lexicWord]#MoSes# scored by one [lexicWord]#character# can be transferred to one or more ally.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A party of 3 adventurers needs to cross over a chasm on a fallen tree.
The [lexicWord]#difficulty level# to cross this improvised bridge without falling is 3.
Each [lexicWord]#player# makes an [lexicWord]#acrobatics# roll.
The result obtained are 5, 4 and 0 [lexicWord]#MoSes#.
The [lexicWord]#player# with the 5 [lexicWord]#MoSes# will help the one who score none; 2 of his [lexicWord]#MoSes# will be transfer to the less fortunate [lexicWord]#character#.
The [lexicWord]#player# with 4 [lexicWord]#MoSes# can also asist and transfer a single [lexicWord]#MoS#.
This will result in a final tally for the party of 3 [lexicWord]#MoSes# for each party member.
Working together, they all succeed in overcoming this obstacle.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A party of 3 adventurers is trying to sneak pass a troop of guards patrolling the streets.
The more stealthy [lexicWord]#characters# will help those who are less apt to avoid detection.
After, if the guards spot one of them, the whole gang will be caught.
A [lexicWord]#group test# is thus in order.

Each [lexicWord]#players# make a roll; they obtain 6, 4 and 1 [lexicWord]#MoSes#.
The [lexicWord]#player# with the 6 [lexicWord]#MoSes# will help the one who score a single [lexicWord]#MoS#; 2 of his [lexicWord]#MoSes# will be transfer to the less fortunate [lexicWord]#character#.
This will result in a final tally for the party of 4, 4 and 3 [lexicWord]#MoSes#.
