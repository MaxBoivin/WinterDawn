:description: This is the description of the different type of tests.
include::Include.adoc[]

Not every context calls for the same type of test.
In some matters, a [lexicWord]#character# can take his time to overcome a static obstacle while in other, time is of the essence.
There will be circumstances where two [lexicWord]#characters# either work against each other or collaborate together.
Some tasks are complex and involve an array of [lexicWord]#skills#.
For some situations, [lexicWord]#characters# won't have a predetermined objective and will simply try perform as good as they can.

The various types of tests for those distinct eventualities are described below.
