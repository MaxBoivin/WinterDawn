[lexicWord]#Open-ended tests# donâ€™t have [lexicWord]#difficulty levels# per se, but the number of [lexicWord]#MoSes# will determine how well a task is performed.
In essence, every [lexicWord]#MoS# counts as a [lexicWord]#hit#.

This type of test is appropriate for tasks like playing a musical instrument, running as fast as you can, cooking a feast, building a shelter for the night, etc.

Those actions have effect for every [lexicWord]#hit# scored.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A [lexicWord]#character# wants to put as much distance between her and an enemy.
The [lexicWord]#player# makes a [lexicWord]#running test#.
Each [lexicWord]#MoS# will allow the [lexicWord]#character# to add half their [lexicWord]#speed# to their movement.
The roll result in 3 [lexicWord]#MoSes.
The [lexicWord]#character# has a [lexicWord]#movement speed# of 9 metres.
She can therefore move 22.5 metres in a round (9 * 0.5 * 3 + 9).
