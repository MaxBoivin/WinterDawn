[lexicWord]#Opposed tests# are used when two [lexicWord]#characters# are working against each other.

A roll is made for each [lexicWord]#character#.
Both rolls can be made with the same [lexicWord]#skill# or each use their own.
The roll with the most [lexicWord]#MoSes# wins.
The difference between the two results gives the number of [lexicWord]#hits# scored by the victor.

If both [lexicWord]#characters# roll the same number of [lexicWord]#MoSes#, the status quo is preserved.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
Two [lexicWord]#character# are engaged in a tug of war.
Both [lexicWord]#players# do a [lexicWord]#lifting# roll and end up with the exact same number of [lexicWord]#MoSes#.
Neither side gains ground; they're in a stand still.
====

If the circumstances make it impossible or unclear to determine the status quo, prior to the rolls being made, the [lexicWord]#GM# will declare one of the [lexicWord]#characters# has having the [lexicWord]#advantage#.
This [lexicWord]#character# will win the [lexicWord]#opposed test# in case of a tie.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A rogue tries to sneak in a manor.
Her [lexicWord]#stealth# will be opposed by the [lexicWord]#awareness# of the [lexicWord]#characters# who could spot her.
Guards on duty are actively looking out for intruders; they will have the [lexicWord]#advantage# on the test.
Meanwhile, the rogue will have the [lexicWord]#advantage# against the unsuspecting occupants of the manor.
====

If a [lexicWord]#character# suffers a [lexicWord]#malus# that would bring his result below 0 [lexicWord]#MoSes#, his result will remain at 0, but each additional [lexicWord]#malus# will allow the opposing [lexicWord]#character# to add one additional die to their roll.
It could happen that both [lexicWord]#character# end up with negative [lexicWord]#MoSes# and grant each other additional dice.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
Two [lexicWord]#characters# are attacking each other across an obstacle covering about half their bodies.
Such type of cover will grant a 2 [lexicWord]#MoSes malus# to each fighter.
The attacker rolls and score only 1 [lexicWord]#MoS#.
The defender fails to score any.
After the [lexicWord]#malus# are applied, the attacker end up with -1 [lexicWord]#MoS# and the defender has -2 [lexicWord]#MoSes#.
The attacker rolls an extra 2 dice and score 1 [lexicWord]#MoS#, which will give her a final result of 1 [lexicWord]#MoS#.
The defender roll an extra die, gets lucky and obtained 2 [lexicWord]#MoSes#, which will be his final result.
The defender therefore scored 1 [lexicWord]#hit#.
====

More details about [lexicWord]#malus# will be given further in this chapter.
