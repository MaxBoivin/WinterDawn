A [lexicWord]#static test# is a single roll made against a [lexicWord]#difficulty level# determined by the [lexicWord]#GM#.

[lexicWord]#Difficulty level# should be based on the inherent obstacle presented by the task, not on how challenging the task should be for the [lexicWord]#character# attempting it.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
//Pushing example
A disc of stone is blocking the entrance of a tomb.
A [lexicWord]#character# wants to push it out of the way.
This boulder is about 1.5 metres in diameter and half a meter thick and the [lexicWord]#GM# estimates that it weight about 720 kilograms (charts are provided in the adventuring chapter to estimate the weight of different objects).
Since it is roughly rounded, it can be rolled.
After consulting the [lexicWord]#athleticism skill# description, the [lexicWord]#GM# determines that 7 [lexicWord]#MoSes# are required to move this stone by 1 metre.
This is a very difficult task.
====

The [lexicWord]#skills#, adventuring and running the game chapters offer guidelines to determine [lexicWord]#difficulty levels# for all kind of situations.
