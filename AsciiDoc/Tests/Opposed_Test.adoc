[lexicWord]#Opposed tests# are used when two [lexicWord]#characters# are working against each other.

A roll is made for each [lexicWord]#character#.
The roll with the most [lexicWord]#MoSes# wins.
The difference between the two results gives the number of [lexicWord]#hits# scored by the victor.

If both [lexicWord]#characters# roll the same number of [lexicWord]#MoSes#, the status quo is preserved.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
Two [lexicWord]#character# are engaged in a tug of war.
Both [lexicWord]#players# roll and end up with the exact same number of [lexicWord]#MoSes#.
Neither sides gain ground, they're in a stand still.
====

If the circumstances make it impossible or unclear to determine the status quo, prior to the rolls being made, the [lexicWord]#GM# will declare one of the [lexicWord]#characters# has having the [lexicWord]#advantage#.
This [lexicWord]#character# will win the [lexicWord]#opposed test# in case of a tie.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A rogue tries to sneak in a manor.
Her [lexicWord]#stealth# will be opposed by the [lexicWord]#alertness# of the [lexicWord]#characters# who could spot her.
Guards on duty are actively looking out for intruders; they will have the [lexicWord]#advantage# on the test.
Meanwhile, the rogue will have the [lexicWord]#advantage# against the unsuspecting occupants of the manor.
