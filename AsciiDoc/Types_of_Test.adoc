:description: This is the description of the different type of tests.
include::Include.adoc[]

Not all situation call for the same type of test; in some situations a [lexicWord]#character# can take their time to overcome a static obstacle while in other circumstances time is of the essence.
Sometimes an additional [lexicWord]#character# will work against them or assist them.
Some tasks are complex and will involve multiple [lexicWord]#skills# and some others donâ€™t have a precise objective and a [lexicWord]#character# will simply try to do as good as they can.

The different types of tests for those different situations are described below.
