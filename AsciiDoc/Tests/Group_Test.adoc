A [lexicWord]#group# test is in order when multiple allied [lexicWord]#characters# are trying to perform the same action and are covering for each other.

Each [lexicWord]#player# makes a roll.
The [lexicWord]#MoSes# from every roll are added and compared to the [lexicWord]#difficulty level#.

The [lexicWord]#difficulty level# for a group should be equivalent to the [lexicWord]#difficulty level[lexicWord]# for a single [lexicWord]#character# to perform the task multiplied by the number of individuals in the group.

.Example
[caption = ""]
====
A group of 5 [lexicWord]#characters# need to cross a narrow catwalk over a chasm.
The [lexicWord]#difficulty level# for an individual [lexicWord]#character# to cross the catwalk would be of 2 on an [lexicWord]#acrobatics# test.
If the party decide to do it as a group, the [lexicWord]#difficulty level# become 10 but the [lexicWord]#MoSes# of every [lexicWord]#player# are added together.
