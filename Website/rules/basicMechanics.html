<h1 id="basicMechanics">Basic Mechanics</h1>

<p>In order to add some objectivity and some randomness to role playing games, some mechanics are used to define what a character can and cannot do, how well equipped they are to overcome different challenges and if they succeed or fail at whatever they are trying to accomplish. </p>

<h2 id="attributes">Attributes</h2>

<p>Six attributes define every character.  Those are agility, power, constitution, erudition, persona and sagacity.<br><br>
Attributes for a humanoid character will usually vary between 4 and 12.  The highest the attribute score the better.  <br><br>
Scores below 4 are crippling, since no test with that attribute can be rolled.<br><br>
Scores of 5 or 4 are considered weak.<br><br>
An average attribute has a value of 6 or 7. <br><br>
Scores of 8 or 9 are considered strong.<br><br>
Scores of 10 or 11 are considered exceptional.<br><br>
Scores of 12 are considered heroic.<br><br>
Scores of 20 or higher are considered supernatural.</p><br>

<h3>Agility</h3>

<p>This attribute represent the dexterity and nimbleness of the character.  It covers fine motor skills, eye-hand coordination and balance.</p>

<h3>Power</h3>

<p>Power represent the physical strength and explosiveness of a character.</p>

<h3>Constitution</h3>

<p>A character's constitution represent not only his health but also their resistance to different types of punishment.  <br><br>
Constitution also affect the rate at which a character recover from injuries.</p>

<h3>Erudition</h3>

<p>Erudition is the attribute for formal learning, academic knowledge and book-smartness. </p>

<h3>Persona</h3>

<p>This attribute represent the strength of personality and charisma of the character.<br><br>
Characters with a high persona score tend to be very polarizing individuals and will leave a strong impression on the people they meet. </p>

<h3>Sagacity</h3>

<p>Sagacity is the wisdom and common sense of the character.  A down to earth, no non-sense, resourceful character would be one with a high sagacity score.<br><br>
If erudition is the book-smart, sagacity will cover the street-smart.  While erudition is very theoretical, sagacity is the practical side of things.</p>

<h2 id="dice">Dice</h2>

<p>WinterDawn is played with polyhedral dice.  6 types of dice are used: 4 sided, 6 sided, 8 sided, 10 sided, 12 sided and 20 sided.<br><br>
Those dice are usually referred to by the letter “d” followed by the number of faces (d4, d6, d8, etc).  If a number is noted before the letter “d” it is to represent the number of dice.  Example: “3d12” means 3 12 sided dice.</p>

<h2 id="skills">Skills</h2>

<p>A large array of different skills covers what a character can reasonably be expected to do.  Each of those skills is linked to one or, sometime, two or three attributes.<br><br>
Some of the skills have five specialities under them.  Those specialities are added to the parent skill when relevant.<br><br>
Each skill is going to be described in the following chapter.</p>

<h3>Skill specialities</h3>

<p>Some skills are subdivided into specialities.  Those skills should no be tested directly but tests should be made with one of the sub-skills.  <br><br>
The ranks of the skill and of the speciality being tested should always be added together.  </p>

<h2 id="skillTest"> Skill Test</h2>

<p>Whenever a player desires to attempt an action with a chance of failure, the GM can ask to perform a skill test.  <br><br>
The number of dice to be rolled for a skill test is 1 + the number of ranks in the skill being tested.  The type of dice is determined by the attribute governing the skill being tested; the dice used must have no more face than the value of the attribute.  <br><br>
The combination of number of dice plus type of dice is called the dice pool. 
Some skills are governed by more than one attribute.  In some cases, the circumstances will determine the appropriate attribute to use while in other, the choice will be left to the player.<br><br>
Example: A skill with a rank of 3 will allow the player to roll 4 dice.  If this skill is governed by an attribute with a value of 7, the player can roll 6 sided dice.  His dice pool for this test would then be of 4d6. <br><br>
Even if a character has no rank in a skill, the player can always at least roll 1 die.<br><br>
A test can involve more than one roll and/or more than one dice pool.  The different types of test will be discussed later in this chapter. <br><br>
A skill test should only be asked for if the success or failure of an action will impact the narrative outcome.</p>

<h3>Dice Pool and Roll</h3>

<p>A dice pool represents the number and type of dice available to a player for their character to perform a certain task or action.<br><br>
A roll is the actual dice used to perform the task or action.<br><br>
In most circumstances dice pools and rolls will be the same but in some cases, a player can decide to roll less dice than their dice pool would allow.  </p>

<h2 id="successAndFailure">Success and Failure</h2>

<p>To succeed on a skill test, a number of measure of success (MoS) equal or superior to a difficulty level must be obtained. </p>

<h2 id="MoS">MoS (Measure of Success)</h2>

<p>Every dice showing 4 through 7, inclusively, represent 1 MoS.  <br><br>
Dice showing from 8 to 11 represent 2 MoSes.  <br><br>
Dice showing between 12 and 15 count for 3 MoSes.  <br><br>
Dice showing between 16 and 19 count for 4 MoSes.<br><br>
Dice showing 20 count for 5 MoSes. </p>

<h2 id="loss">Loss</h2>

<p>Dice showing 1 subtract 1 MoS.  It is possible to end up with a negative number of MoSes which are called Losses.<br><br>
Many situations have dire consequences for rolling losses.</p>

<h2 id="difficultyLevel">Difficulty Level</h2>

<p>There is a vast difference in difficulty between different tasks; some are mundane and some can be near impossible.<br><br>
Easy tasks need 1 MoS to be accomplished.  Such tasks have 50% chance of being successful when attempted by an average character untrained in the skill used.<br><br>
Moderate tasks need 2 MoSes to be accomplished.  An average character need to be at least initiated in the skill to be tested to be able to succeed at such a task.<br><br>
Difficult task need 3 MoSes to be accomplished.  Those tasks will be challenging for any average character, even if this one is well trained in the skill being tested.<br><br>
Very difficult tasks need 4 MoSes to be accomplished.  Even a character highly trained in the skill being tested can be expected to fail such tasks about 2 times out of 3.<br><br>
Near impossible tasks need 5 MoSes to be accomplished.  A character accomplishing such a task in front of an audience will leave them in awe.<br><br>
Legendary tasks need 6 or more MoSes to be accomplished.  Witnesses of such accomplishment will have a hard time finding people to believe their recounting of the event.<br><br>
Those numbers are for simple tasks which can be done in one action, in a short amount of time.  <br><br>
The difficulty level is either determined by the GM, by a roll made by an opponent or by different environmental factors. </p>

<h2 id="hits">Hits</h2>

<p>MoSes exceeding the difficulty level are called hits.<br><br>
Many skills, spells and other abilities have varying degree of effectiveness depending on the number of hits obtained on a roll. </p>

<h2 id="typesOfTest">Types of Test</h2>

<p>Not all situation call for the same type of test; in some situations a character can take their time to overcome a static obstacle while in other circumstances time is of the essence.  Sometimes an additional character will work against them or assist them.  Some tasks are complex and will involve multiple skills and some other don’t have a precise objective and a character will simply try to do as good as they can.<br><br>
The different types of tests for those different situations are described below.</p>

<h3>Static Test</h3>

<p>A static test is a roll made against a difficulty level determined by the GM.  <br><br>
Difficulty level should be based on the inherent difficulty of task, not on how difficult the task should be to the character. <br><br>
The skills chapter and adventuring chapter offer guidelines to determine difficulty level. </p>

<h3>Opposed Test</h3>

<p>An opposed test is one where two characters are working against each other for the completion of a task.  <br><br>
A roll is made for each character.  The difference between those rolls become the number of hits scored by the characters with the most MoSes. <br><br>
Losses are added to the hits of the winning party.<br><br>
If both characters roll the same number of MoSes, the status quo is preserved.  <br><br>
In some circumstances, it is impossible or unclear to determine the status quo.  In those occurrences, the GM should determine if one of the characters has the advantage; this character will win the opposed test in case of a tie.<br><br>
Example: A rogue tries to sneak in a manor.  Their stealth test will be opposed by a perception & vigilance made by the characters who could spot him.  The guards expecting intruders and looking for them will have advantage on their tests while the rogue will have advantage when opposed by the unsuspecting occupants of the manor.</p>

<h3>Open-Ended Test</h3>

<p>Open-ended tests don’t have difficulty levels but the number of MoSes will determine how well the task is performed.  In essence, every MoS is a hit.  <br><br>
Examples of tasks for which an open-ended test would be appropriate would include playing a musical instrument, running as fast as one can, cooking a nice meal, building a shelter to spend the night, etc.</p>

<h3>Rolling Test</h3>

<p>Rolling test are tests that can be made in multiple rolls.  The MoSes from every roll are added together to beat the difficulty level.  They are used for tasks which can be worked on over time.  Each roll will represent a certain amount of time passed.<br><br>
Two types of rolling test exist: first fail and step back.</p>

<h4>First Fail Rolling Test</h4>

<p>A first fail rolling test allows the player to keep rolling and adding their MoSes until one roll get no MoSes.  <br><br>
Example: A thief trying to pick a lock could do so as a first fail rolling test; for every roll 6 seconds pass, if a roll obtain no MoSes before they reach the difficulty level they fail and have to start again.</p>

<h4>Step Back Rolling Test</h4>

<p>A step back rolling test does not fail upon a roll with no MoSes or on a roll with loses.  The loses are simply subtracted from the MoSes accumulated.  If the number of accumulated MoSes drop to 0, the test fails.<br><br>
Example: A woodworker is building a cart.  Every day they can make a Woodworking roll.  If on a day they score some loses, they not only make no progress on that day but damage something they already built.  </p>

<h3>Assisted Test</h3>

<p>In some circumstances two or more characters can work together on a task.  When doing so, each character can make a roll and the MoSes are added together to beat a difficulty level. <br><br>
The GM can put a limit on the number of characters who can effectively work on a task.<br><br>
Example: Two characters try to move a large log; they can work together and add their MoSes to beat the difficulty level.</p>

<h4>Assisted Test, Halved</h4>

<p>Halved assisted test are used for tasks where an assistant help but does not double the efficiency of the work being done.  In those cases, the main performer of the task count their MoSes normally while the assistants will only add half their MoSes to the total.  </p>

<h3>Group Test</h3>

<p>A group test is in order when multiple allied characters are trying to perform the same action and are covering for each other.<br><br>
Each player make a roll.  The MoSes from every rolls are added and compared to the difficulty level.  
The difficulty level for a group should be equivalent to the difficulty level for a single character to perform the task multiplied by the number of individuals in the group.<br><br>
Example: A group of 5 characters need to cross a narrow catwalk over a chasm.  The difficulty level for an individual character to cross the catwalk would be of 2 on an acrobatics test.  If the party decide to do it as a group, the difficulty level become 10 but the MoSes of every player are added together. </p>

<h3>Composed Test</h3>

<p>Composed test are tests which require two or more rolls made with different skills.  The MoSes are added together to beat the difficulty level. <br><br>
Example: Disabling a trap can be made with a composed test of mechanics, to understand the trap design, and sleight of hands, to disable it without triggering. </p>

<h4>Rolling Composed Test</h4>

<p>In some case, a test is both composed and rolling.  In such a situation, the skills involved are alternated.<br><br>
Example: Picking a lock will require mechanics to understand the lock and sleight of hand to pick it. Difficult lock will have high difficulty level and will require multiple roll.  The player will have to alternate between mechanics and sleight of hand every roll, until the lock is unlocked or until they fail the roll.</p>

<h3>Mixed Test</h3>

<p>A mixed test is simply a test that combines more than one of the previous types.<br><br>
Example: If two characters are working on building a cart, they can make an open-ended assisted test.</p>

<h2 id="bonusAndMalus">Bonus and Malus</h2>

<p>Characters can gain bonus or suffer malus depending on the situation they have to perform a task.<br><br>  
Bonuses come in two form: Additional MoSes or additional dice to a dice pool. <br><br>
Bonuses to MoSes are noted by a simple +1 MoS.  Bonuses to a dice pool are noted as +1d.<br><br>
To benefit from bonus MoSes a player must have dice leftover in their dice pool.  <br><br>
Bonuses giving extra dice can be used even with a depleted dice pool.<br><br>
Malus removes MoSes from a roll.  They are noted as -1 MoS.  </p>

<h2 id="ressoundingSuccess">Resounding Success</h2>

<p>For a roll to be considered a resounding success two conditions must be met: 1) the task attempted must be successful and 2) the number of MoSes obtained on the roll (before adding any bonus MoSes) must be equal or greater to the number of dice granted by the dice pool for this task.<br><br>
 Resounding success can be used to regain spirit or gain experience.  Details are given further in this chapter.</p>

<h2 id="completeFailure">Complete Failure</h2>

<p>A roll ending up with Losses (before any malus has been applied) is a complete failure of the character.<br><br>
A complete failure can cause a lost of spirit or a gain of experience.  While outside of combat, if a player rolls a complete failure they must make a Confidence & ego test with a difficulty level equals to 1 + the number of losses.  If this roll is successful, the player can put an experience points in the failed skill.  If the roll is unsuccessful, the character loses 1 spirit point per ranks in the failed skill.<br><br>
Complete failures can also imply a complication.  Some examples are given in the description of certain tasks.  <br><br>
In case of a complete failure on an opposed test, the losses are generally added to the roll of the opposing player. </p>

<h2 id="spirit">Spirit</h2>

<p>Spirit points represent both the stamina and moral of a character.<br><br>
A dice pool can never contain more dice than the current number of spirit points of the character.<br><br>
The maximum amount of spirit points for a character is equal to the sum of his constitution, persona and sagacity. <br><br>
Spirit will vastly fluctuate during play.  Many circumstances can drain or raise the spirit of a character.  </p>

<h3>Spirit DraIn</h3>

<p>Common causes of loss of spirit points include fighting, long travel, restless nights, starvation, extreme weather, seeing an ally fall in combat, etc.  Each will be describe in their appropriate section.<br><br>
While outside of combat, rolling a complete failure can cause a lost of spirit.  Details in the complete failure section.</p>

<h3>Increasing Dice Pool with Spirit</h3>

<p>A player can also spend the spirit of their character to add dice to a dice pool (before any roll is made).  One die can be added at a cost equal to the current number of dice in the dice pool.  A player can add to a dice pool a number of dice equal to the rank of the skill being tested.<br><br>
Example: A character with a cooking skill of 3 would have a dice pool of 4 dice.  If the player wants to increase their chance of succeeding at creating a sumptuous meal, they could decide to spend 4 spirit points to add an additional die, 9 spirit points to add two additional dice (4 + 5) or 15 spirit points (4 + 5 + 6) to raise their dice pool to 7 dice. </p>

<h3>Regaining Spirit</h3>

<p>A character can replenish their spirit in many different ways: A good night of sleep, eating a good meal, being victorious in combat, witnessing a beautiful artistic performance, etc.  Details about the different ways to regain spirit will be given in their respective sections.<br><br> 
Whenever a character wake up from an prolonged sleep, the player can regain half their constitution worth of spirit points.  <br><br>
While outside of combat, whenever a player rolls a resounding success, they can decide to regain 2 spirit point per MoSes instead of getting an experience point.</p>

<h2 id="improvingSkillsAndAttributes">Improving Skills and Attributes</h2>

<p>Experience is gained per skills and per attributes and cannot be transferred.<br><br>
A character can gain experience for their skills in a few different ways:<br><br>
While outside combat, rolling a resounding success grant 1 experience point in the skill used.<br><br>
While outside combat, a player rolling a complete failure could gain an experience point if they succeed a Confidence & ego test.  Details in the complete failure section.<br><br>
At the end of a combat, the GM should count the number of injuries boxes, major and minor, of all the characters opposing the party of players.  This sum represents the number of experience points to be divided amongst the players.  The players are free to distribute the experience they receive between the skills they used during this combat as they see fit.<br><br>
Finally, the GM is free to award experience points to a player when this one uses a skill in an original manner to advance a significant plot point. <br><br>
A player can raise the rank of a skill at any moment by spending an amount of experience points linked to that skill equal to the current rank of the skill plus 1, multiplied by 4.  <br><br>
Example: a skill at a rank of 2 will cost 12 experience points ((2 + 1)*4) to be raised to 3.
Skills subdivided in specialities does not directly gain experience but experience is attributed to the speciality being tested.  <br><br>
Speciality ranks are raised in the same manner as for skills but the rank of the parent skill should always be added to the rank of the speciality for calculation of the cost.<br><br>
Skills subdivided in specialities are raised by lowering the rank of three different child specialities by 1 to raise the parent skill rank by 1. <br><br>
Example: A character with an athleticism rank of 1, with the specialities climbing 2, running 1 and jumping 1, can subtract 1 from those three specialities, brining back climbing to 1, jumping and running to 0 to increase athleticism to 2.  This will not affect the dice pool of any of the three specialities which were part of the trade but will increase the dice pool of the other two athleticism specialities, lifting & pushing and swimming. <br><br>
Every time a player uses experience to raise the level of a skill or a speciality, they can add 2 experience points in the attribute governing this skill.  If this skill is governed by more than one attribute, the experience can be split between the governing attributes. <br><br>
Attributes can be raised by spending an amount of experience points equal to the current level of the attribute.  <br><br>
Some traits can be purchased using skill or attribute experience. Details in the character creation section.
Whenever a player spend experience, either to raise a skill, raise an attribute or purchase a traits, they should note the amount of experience spent in the experience spent space of the character sheet.  This has no mechanical advantages and serve solely for the GM to balance the challenges presented to the players. 
Lowering specialities ranks to increase the parent skill does not give attribute experience and should not be included in then experience spent. </p>

<h3>Mentoring</h3>

<p>A character can help another improve a skill by mentoring.  The mentor’s skill rank must be above the skill rank of the apprentice by at least 2 steps. <br><br>
When the mentor uses the skill to perform a task, the apprentice has a chance of gaining experience.
If the task is of a type which can be assisted, the apprentice must assist with their own dice pool.  Whenever the mentor rolls a resounding success, both him and the apprentice can gain an experience point in the skill.  If the apprentice rolls a resounding success, the normal rule apply. <br><br>
 If the task is one where assistance is impossible or impractical, the apprentice must looks closely.  If the mentor rolls a resounding success the experience point is attributed to the apprentice. </p>

<h3>Training and sparing</h3>

<p>Two characters can work together to improve skills which require opposed test (can be the same or two different skills).   <br><br>
The two characters each make their roll normally but, whenever one of them rolls a resounding success both can put an experience points in the skill they were training. <br><br>
Sparing is training for combat skills.  The rules are the same as for regular combat but damage does not have to be rolled.  For the characters to be eligible to gain any experience the combat must last 5 rounds. <br><br>
The characters sparring do not gain experience based on the injuries boxes of their opponent but on the number of round they sparred.  For every 5 rounds, each character gain 1 experience point.<br><br>
Sparing is not limited to two characters.  </p>
